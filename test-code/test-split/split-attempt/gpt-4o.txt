 Justifications:
    1) **Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Rephrasing for Clarity and Formality:**
   - Original: "while working as a congressman"
   - Improved: "While serving as a congressman"
   - This change elevates the formality and conveys a sense of duty and service.

2. **Enhanced Verb Usage:**
   - Original: "has passed"
   - Improved: "has successfully passed"
   - Adding "successfully" emphasizes the accomplishment and draws attention to Alex's effectiveness in his role.

3. **Variety of Language:**
   - Original: "many bills"
   - Improved: "numerous bills"
   - Using "numerous" instead of "many" adds variety and a slightly more sophisticated tone to the sentence.

These adjustments together result in a more polished and impactful sentence that clearly highlights Alex’s achievements.
    2) ### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Changed "has passed" to "has successfully passed"**:
   - The word "successfully" adds emphasis on the achievement, indicating that Alex's efforts were fruitful and went beyond just the action of passing bills.
   
2. **Replaced "many" with "numerous"**:
   - The word "numerous" is slightly more formal and conveys a sense of a significant quantity more effectively than "many."
   
3. **Replaced "while working as a congressman" with "during his tenure as a congressman"**:
   - "During his tenure" suggests a more specific and professional timeframe, indicating the period when Alex was in office.
   - Additionally, "working as a congressman" is a bit redundant because being a congressman inherently involves work; thus, "tenure" succinctly covers the idea.

Overall, the changes aim to provide clarity, formality, and a sense of accomplishment.
    3) Explanation of changes:
1. **"During his tenure as a congressman"** - This phrase provides a more formal and context-rich introduction than simply "while working as a congressman." It conveys the time period and nature of his service.
2. **"Successfully passed"** - Adding "successfully" emphasizes his achievements, highlighting the positive outcome of his efforts.
3. **"Numerous bills"** - Replacing "many" with "numerous" maintains the meaning but adds a slightly more sophisticated tone. 

These changes together enhance the clarity, formality, and emphasis of the original sentence.

2. **"Numerous"** replaced "many" to provide a slightly more formal and impactful tone.
3. **"During her tenure"** replaced "while working" to sound more professional and to specifically pinpoint the period of her service.
4. **"As a congresswoman"** was kept the same for clarity but restructured the sentence to flow better with the changes.

2. **Verb Enhancement:** Changed "has passed" to "has successfully passed," adding a sense of achievement and emphasizing success.

    10) "Alex appeared exceptionally handsome in the photo."

Explanation of changes:
1. "Looked" has been replaced with "appeared" to provide a slightly more formal and polished tone.
2. "Very" has been replaced with "exceptionally" to enhance the intensity of the adjective "handsome," making the compliment stronger and more impactful.
    11) **Changes and Explanation:**

1. **"Looked" to "appeared":**
   - "Appeared" has a slightly more formal tone and can suggest a clearer impression formed by the observer.
2. **"Very" to "exceptionally":**
   - "Exceptionally" is a stronger, more vivid adjective that better emphasizes the degree of handsomeness.
3. **"Photo" to "photograph":**
   - "Photograph" is a more formal and specific word compared to "photo."

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Verb Choice:** Changed "looked" to "appeared." This slight change can add a nuance of formality and elegance to the sentence.
   
2. **Intensifier:** Replaced "very" with "strikingly." "Very" is often overused and can be replaced with more descriptive adverbs to add vividness to the sentence. "Strikingly" provides a stronger, more evocative intensifier for "handsome."

3. **Flow and Tone:** The combination of these changes makes the sentence flow better and elevates the tone, making it more sophisticated and engaging.
    13) "Alex looked stunning in the photo."

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Word Choice - "Stunning":**
   - Replaced "very beautiful" with "stunning". "Stunning" is a more impactful and vivid adjective that conveys a stronger sense of admiration and awe.

2. **Conciseness:**
   - The sentence is more concise by using "stunning," which encapsulates the meaning of "very beautiful" in a single word, making the sentence more powerful without additional words. 

This revised sentence is more expressive and engaging while maintaining the original meaning.
    14) "Alex appeared stunning in the photo."

**Explanation of the changes:**
1. **Word Choice**: "Appeared" replaces "looked." While both words are similar, "appeared" can convey a more refined tone.
2. **Adjective Upgrade**: "Stunning" replaces "very beautiful." This upgrade intensifies the compliment and eliminates the need for "very," making the sentence more concise and impactful.
    15) Original:
- Alex looked very beautiful in the photo.

Improved:
- Alex appeared stunning in the photograph.

Changes and explanations:
1. **"looked" to "appeared"**: The word "appeared" can have a slightly more formal and refined tone than "looked".

3. **"photo" to "photograph"**: The term "photograph" is slightly more formal and elegant than "photo", providing a more polished finish to the sentence.

Overall, these changes make the sentence sound more refined and provide a more vivid description.
    16) ### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Use of a More Specific Verb:**
   - "Appeared" is used instead of "looked." While "looked" is not incorrect, "appeared" can provide a slightly more formal and polished tone to the sentence.
   
2. **More Potent Adjective:**
   - "Exceptionally" replaces "very." The word "very" is often considered weak and overused in writing. Using "exceptionally" adds stronger emphasis and sophistication to the description.
    17) **Changes Made:**

1. **"Looked" to "appeared":** The word "appeared" gives a slightly more polished and sophisticated feel to the sentence.
2. **"Very attractive" to "exceptionally striking":** "Exceptionally striking" is a more vivid and powerful description than "very attractive," which enhances the reader's impression.
3. **Overall improvement:** The changes aim to create a more refined and impactful sentence that provides a stronger visual image for the reader.
