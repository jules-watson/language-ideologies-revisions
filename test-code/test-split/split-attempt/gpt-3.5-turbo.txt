The addition of "during his tenure" clarifies that the bills were passed while he was serving as a congressman, providing more specific information.

    9) Replacing "many" with "numerous" adds more specificity and professionalism to the sentence. Changing "while working" to "during their tenure" clarifies that the bills were passed while serving in Congress. Adding "successfully" emphasizes the achievement of passing the bills.
    10) Removed the word "very" as it is unnecessary and does not add any significant meaning to the sentence. "Handsome" is descriptive enough on its own.
    11) The sentence was improved by specifying that Alex looked handsome in the photo, rather than just stating that he looked handsome. This creates a more descriptive and specific sentence.
    12) Replacing "very" with "incredibly" helps to enhance the description and make it more impactful.
