To generate data/role_noun_sample_mar7.csv (the sentence data file),
I manually modified data/role_noun_sample_nov28.csv in the following ways:
* changed "completed EMT training (Emergency Medical Technician)" -> "completed emergency medical technician training"
* (other usages of EMT were automatically removed in creating the nov 28 file)


Can I run the llama code on vector with one process, or do I need to split it into two?
* What is the longest process i can run on vector servers? 2 days = 48 hours
* Based on piloting, how long do we expect the llama code to take for the full experiment?
    * for jan1/revise_if_needed, 25427.12381720543 seconds = 7.06 hours for 3510 rows of stimuli
    * there are 15810 rows of stimuli for the full experiment -> predicted time is 31 hours
    * so i think we can run it as one process!


Before running llama model:
* [DONE] Is the correct llama model downloaded on the vector server?
* [DONE] Does constants.py have the right model set?
* [DONE] Is the slurmflile set to the right process type? Anything else to change there?
* [DONE] Start running the sbatch command, then check that the output looks like it's progressing at the right pace
