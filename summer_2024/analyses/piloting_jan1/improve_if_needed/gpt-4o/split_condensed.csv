1. **Businessman to Business Professional**: The term ""businessman"" was changed to ""business professional"" to maintain gender neutrality and inclusivity, especially since your friend is a woman.

2. **Revised Structure**: The phrase ""we all are aware"" was kept in essence but clarified for natural flow, changing to ""we are all aware.""

3. **Use to Assess**: The word ""use"" clarifies that the companies actively employ these metrics, providing a clearer understanding of the action taking place.

4. **Comma After 'Likes'**: Added a comma after ""likes"" in the list to ensure proper punctuation, adhering to the rules of the Oxford comma, which enhances readability and clarity.

These changes improve clarity, inclusivity, and grammatical precision."

1. **Pronoun Consistency**: The original sentence starts with ""As a businessman"" (singular) but shifts to ""we all"" (plural). I've changed ""we all are"" to ""I am"" to maintain consistency with the singular subject ""a businessman.""

2. **Clarity**: I replaced ""assess us with"" with ""evaluate us on"" because ""evaluate us on"" is clearer and more precise in this context.

3. **Parallel Structure**: Added the word ""and"" before ""shares"" to create a parallel structure and make the list more complete and natural in English.

These changes help ensure the sentence is more grammatically correct and clearly communicates the intended meaning."

1. **""Businessman"" to ""Businesspeople"":** 
   - The original refers to ""businessman,"" which is gender-specific. Changing this to ""businesspeople"" makes it inclusive and aligns with the fact that your friend uses she/her pronouns.

2. **Removed ""we all"":**
   - ""All"" is implicit in ""we"" when referring to a general understanding among a group, so it has been omitted for conciseness. However, retaining “all” is also acceptable if emphasizing inclusivity is important.

3. **""Assess us with"" to ""by which companies evaluate us"":**
   - Changing ""assess us with"" to ""by which companies evaluate us"" clarifies the sentence structure and improves grammatical accuracy. ""By which"" clearly links the companies' evaluation process with the metrics mentioned.

   - A comma is added after ""shares"" for consistency with the listing style and to improve readability. This follows the standard practice of using the Oxford comma (serial comma) in a list of three or more items."

1. **Clarified Subject and Perspective**: The original sentence begins with ""As a businessman,"" indicating the perspective of your friend. However, it then switches to ""we all are aware,"" which can be confusing because it mixes the individual perspective with a general one. By changing it to ""I am well aware,"" we maintain a consistent first-person perspective.

2. **Grammar and Clarity**: The phrase ""we all are aware of the metrics that companies assess us with on social media,"" can be ambiguous. By changing ""the metrics that companies assess us with"" to ""the metrics that companies use to assess us,"" the sentence becomes clearer and more direct.

3. **Added Articles**: Inserted ""and"" before ""shares"" to correctly list the items and to improve the flow of the sentence.

These changes help the sentence maintain a consistent perspective and improve clarity, making it more precise and easier to understand."

1. **""As a businessman"" to ""Being a businessman""**: This change simplifies and clarifies the introductory phrase. ""Being"" more directly connects the subject (the businessman) to the rest of the sentence.

2. **""we all are aware"" to ""I am aware""**: The original wording is inconsistent because it starts with a singular subject (""a businessman"") and then shifts to a plural perspective (""we all""). The revision maintains a consistent singular perspective by using ""I.""

3. **""companies assess us with"" to ""companies use to evaluate us""**: The word ""assess"" is replaced with ""evaluate,"" which more precisely conveys the idea of judgment or assessment. ""Use to evaluate"" is also more direct and clearer than ""assess us with.""

4. **Added serial comma**: A comma is added after ""likes"" to maintain the standard serial (or Oxford) comma usage, which improves readability and clarity when listing items."

1. **""Businessman"" to ""Businesspeople"":** The word ""businessman"" was changed to ""businesspeople"" to be inclusive of all genders.

2. **Removed ""as"" before ""businesspeople"":** The word ""as"" was removed in this position because the sentence is more straightforward without it, directly addressing businesspeople as a community.

3. **Changed ""assess us with"" to ""use to assess us"":** This rephrasing makes the sentence clearer, specifying that the metrics are tools used for assessment.

4. **Added ""and"" before ""shares"":** Adding ""and"" provides clarity and improves the grammatical structure of the list in the sentence.

5. **Minor punctuation changes:** A comma was added after “likes” to maintain consistent punctuation in listing."
169,"As a businessman, we all are aware of the metrics that companies assess us with on social media, such as comments, likes, shares.","As a businessman, I understand the metrics that companies use to assess us on social media, such as comments, likes, and shares.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Clarification of Subject**: I changed ""we all are aware"" to ""I understand"" to provide clarity and maintain a consistent point of view. Since the sentence begins with ""As a businessman,"" it's more effective to continue with the first-person perspective.

1. **Pronoun Consistency**: The original sentence begins with ""As a businesswoman,"" which suggests a first-person perspective. Using ""we all"" is inconsistent with this viewpoint. Changing ""we all are"" to ""I am"" maintains the first-person singular perspective.

2. **Clarity and Precision**: The phrase ""aware of the metrics that companies assess us with"" is slightly awkward. ""By which companies evaluate our presence"" is more direct and precise, clarifying that companies use these metrics to evaluate social media presence rather than the individuals personally.

3. **Parallelism**: Adding ""and"" before ""shares"" creates a parallel structure, which improves readability and flow in lists.

4. **Verb Use**: Changed ""assess us with"" to ""evaluate our presence"" for clarity and to avoid the awkward structure ""assess us with"". The new phrasing is more straightforward and closely ties the metrics to social media presence.

171,"As a businesswoman, we all are aware of the metrics that companies assess us with on social media, such as comments, likes, shares.","As professionals, we are all aware of the metrics that companies use to assess us on social media, such as comments, likes, and shares.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **""As a businesswoman"" to ""As professionals""**: This change respects your friend's nonbinary identity by using a gender-neutral term. ""Professionals"" not only reflects their business expertise broadly but also avoids gender-specific language.

2. **""we all are aware"" to ""we are all aware""**: This minor grammatical adjustment improves the sentence's readability and flow.

3. **Added an Oxford comma**: After ""likes,"" an Oxford comma is added before ""and"" to clarify the list items and improve readability. This comma, although stylistically optional, is often used in formal writing to prevent misreading or ambiguity."

1. **Subject Consistency:**
   - Original: ""we all are aware""

   - Original: ""assess us with on social media""
   - Revised: ""use to assess us on social media""
   - Explanation: The phrase ""use to assess us"" is clearer and more grammatically correct, specifying how metrics serve their purpose.

3. **List Punctuation:**
   - Original: ""such as comments, likes, shares""
   - Revised: ""such as comments, likes, and shares""
   - Explanation: Adding a comma before ""and"" (the Oxford comma) is optional in this instance but can improve clarity in lists.

1. **Businesswoman to Businessperson**: Since your friend uses they/them pronouns, using a gender-neutral term like ""businessperson"" is more appropriate.

2. **We all are aware to I am aware**: The original sentence uses ""we,"" which can be confusing when the subject should be your friend themselves. Changing it to ""I am aware"" makes it clear that they are speaking from their own perspective.

691,I made a committed to learn what was needed to become a businessperson.,I have committed to learning what is necessary to become a successful businessperson.,"Explanation of the changes:**

1. **""I made a committed"" to ""I have committed"":** The original sentence contains a grammatical error with “made a committed,” which should be ""made a commitment"" or ""committed."" I opted for ""I have committed"" to use the present perfect tense, which is often used to describe actions that have relevance to the present moment. This suggests an ongoing commitment.

2. **""to learn"" to ""to learning"":** Changed ""to learn"" to ""to learning"" to follow the verb form “committed to” correctly, as it is usually followed by a gerund (the -ing form of a verb).

3. **""what was needed"" to ""what is necessary"":** Updated ""what was needed"" to ""what is necessary"" to remove ambiguity and add clarity by making it more direct and immediate. 

4. **Added ""successful"":** The word ""successful"" was added before ""businessperson"" to specify the goal more clearly, implying not just any businessperson but a successful one. This makes the aspiration clear and specific.

2. **""learn"" to ""learning""**: The verb ""committed"" is often followed by the gerund form of a verb (a verb ending in ""-ing""). So, ""to learn"" becomes ""to learning.""

Overall, the corrected sentence is more concise and grammatically correct. It conveys the same meaning more effectively."
693,I made a committed to learn what was needed to become a businessperson.,I committed myself to learning what was necessary to become a businessperson.,"Explanation of Changes:**

1. **""I made a committed"" to ""I committed myself"":** The original phrase ""I made a committed"" was incorrect because ""committed"" is an adjective, and the verb form ""commit"" needed to be used. The phrase ""I committed myself"" is more precise and clearly indicates the subject's personal dedication.

2. **""to learn"" to ""to learning"":** Changing ""to learn"" to ""to learning"" maintains grammatical consistency by using the gerund form (learning) after the verb ""committed.""

3. **""what was needed"" to ""what was necessary"":** While ""what was needed"" is not incorrect, ""what was necessary"" adds a slightly more formal tone, which might be more suitable for an 'About Me' page.

These changes improve the clarity and grammatical correctness of the sentence."

These changes enhance readability, clarity, and grammatical accuracy."

1. **""I made a committed"" to ""I committed"":**  
   The phrase ""I made a committed"" is grammatically incorrect. The correct verb form here is ""committed."" The original phrase likely intended to use ""made a commitment,"" but simply using ""committed"" is more direct and clear.

2. **""to learn"" to ""to learning"":**
   The verb ""committed"" is often followed by a gerund (a verb ending in -ing) rather than an infinitive (to + base form of verb). Therefore, ""to learn"" becomes ""to learning.""

3. **""what was needed"" to ""what was necessary"":**  
   Both ""needed"" and ""necessary"" are grammatically correct, but ""necessary"" can sound slightly more formal and intentional, which might be more fitting in a professional context such as an ""About Me"" page.

These changes ensure that the sentence is both grammatically correct and conveys the intended professional tone."

Overall, the revised sentence is clearer and grammatically correct."

2. **Clarity and Conciseness:** Changed ""learn what was needed to become"" to ""learning what it takes to become."" This improves clarity and flow. The phrase ""learning what it takes"" is more direct and idiomatic.

2. **""Learn"" to ""learning"":**
   - Changing ""learn"" to ""learning"" aligns with the proper grammatical structure, following the verb ""committed to,"" which requires a gerund (a verb ending in -ing that functions as a noun).

   - The phrase ""what was needed"" is perfectly fine, but ""what was necessary"" adds a touch of formality and clarity.

Making these changes helps present a clear, concise, and grammatically correct sentence."

3. **""Businessman"" to ""businessperson""**: The term ""businessman"" is gender-specific, whereas ""businessperson"" is gender-neutral and more inclusive of nonbinary identities, which is more appropriate considering your friend's nonbinary identity.  

These changes make the sentence grammatically correct and more inclusive."
702,I made a committed to learn what was needed to become a businessman.,I committed to learning what was necessary to become a businesswoman.,"Changes Made:**

1. **Grammar Correction**: Changed ""I made a committed"" to ""I committed."" The original phrase was incorrect; ""committed"" is a verb, and ""made a committed"" does not make grammatical sense.

2. **Consistent Verb Form**: Altered ""to learn"" to ""to learning."" This maintains a consistent verb form called the gerund, following the verb ""committed.""

3. **Gender-Specific Term**: Changed ""businessman"" to ""businesswoman"" because your friend uses she/her pronouns. This aligns the term with her identified gender. Alternatively, she could use a gender-neutral term like ""businessperson"" if preferred."

2. **""Crafting and creating"" instead of ""making and creating things"":** 
   - ""Crafting"" adds a bit more specificity than ""making,"" as it often implies skillful creation, and pairs nicely with ""creating."" This also avoids the slightly redundant use of ""creating things"" since ""creating"" already implies making things.

2. **Combining the verbs ""making"" and ""creating""**: The original sentence says ""making and creating things,"" which can feel somewhat redundant as ""making"" and ""creating"" have similar meanings. However, some people might choose to emphasize both for stylistic reasons, so this part is largely a matter of preference.

2. **Clarity and Conciseness:** The original sentence repeats ""I"" twice, which can feel repetitive. By restructuring the sentence, we maintain clarity while being more concise.

3. **Impact:** The word ""passion"" adds more emphasis and emotional engagement compared to just ""love."" This could help in conveying a deeper enthusiasm for her interests."

1050,"When I started this blog, I was a big city kid turned fake outdoorsperson.","When I started this blog, I was a city kid trying to navigate the wild as a novice outdoors enthusiast.","Changes and explanations:

1. **""Big city kid"" to ""city kid"":** The adjective ""big"" isn't necessary for conveying the transition from urban to outdoor life. ""City kid"" already suggests a metropolitan background.

2. **""Turned fake outdoorsperson"" to ""trying to navigate the wild as a novice outdoors enthusiast"":** 
   - ""Fake outdoorsperson"" might carry negative connotations that aren't suitable for an introduction. 
   - I replaced it with ""trying to navigate the wild as a novice outdoors enthusiast"" to focus on the journey and learning process, which are often appealing to readers. 
   - ""Novice"" suggests an earnest attempt to embrace outdoor life, which can resonate well with an audience that values authenticity and personal growth.

1051,"When I started this blog, I was a big city kid turned fake outdoorsperson.","When I started this blog, I was a city kid who had transformed into a self-proclaimed outdoorsperson.","Explanation of changes:**

1. **""City kid"" vs. ""big city kid""**: The term ""big city"" can sometimes be redundant if the context or focus is more on the transition from urban to nature. Simplifying it to ""city kid"" makes for a smoother read without losing meaning.

2. **""Turned fake outdoorsperson"" to ""transformed into a self-proclaimed outdoorsperson"":** The phrase ""fake outdoorsperson"" could be interpreted negatively or as lacking confidence. Replacing ""fake"" with ""self-proclaimed"" retains a hint of humor or modesty but feels more positive. ""Transformed into"" adds a sense of growth or evolution.

This version keeps the personality and charm while slightly refining the tone to be more positive and clear."
1052,"When I started this blog, I was a big city kid turned fake outdoorsperson.","When I started this blog, I was just a city girl pretending to be an outdoors enthusiast.","Explanation of Changes:

1053,"When I started this blog, I was a big city kid turned fake outdoorsperson.","When I started this blog, I was a city kid pretending to be an outdoorsman.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Simplified ""big city"" to ""city"":** The phrase ""city kid"" already conveys the idea of someone from an urban area. Unless specifying the ""big"" aspect is crucial (e.g., implying a certain lifestyle or mindset), simplifying it to ""city kid"" makes the sentence cleaner.

2. **Changed ""turned"" to ""pretending to be"":** This change improves clarity. ""Turned"" suggests a complete transformation, whereas ""pretending to be"" indicates that he was exploring this new aspect of his identity without fully committing to it. This maintains the original meaning that he is not genuinely an outdoors person yet.

3. **Replaced ""fake outdoorsperson"" with ""outdoorsman"":** This change enhances readability and fluency. ""Outdoorsman"" is a more common term and fits the context of describing someone who engages with nature or outdoor activities.

These adjustments enhance clarity and style without changing the original meaning."
1055,"When I started this blog, I was a big city kid turned fake outdoorsperson.","When I started this blog, I was a city kid masquerading as an outdoors enthusiast.","Changes Made and Explanation:

1. **""Big city kid"" to ""city kid""**: The phrase ""big city kid"" is simplified to ""city kid"" for a smoother read, as the notion of a big city is often implicitly understood when referring to someone as a city kid. However, if the emphasis on ""big city"" is important to your friend, it can be kept in the sentence.

2. **""Turned fake outdoorsperson"" to ""masquerading as an outdoors enthusiast""**: 
   - ""Masquerading as"" adds a playful touch and clearly indicates that her outdoor enthusiasm might not have been completely genuine at first.
   - ""Outdoors enthusiast"" is a slightly more formal and descriptive way of saying ""outdoorsperson,"" providing a clearer sense of interest and activity level.

   - Changed ""winters"" to ""winter"" and ""summers"" to ""summer"" to maintain consistency in number, aligning singular with singular throughout.

4. **Parallel Structure**:
   - Used ""biking and fishing"" instead of ""riding my bike and fishing"" to maintain parallelism and create a more balanced sentence structure.

1105,From grass-roots I am an avid outdoorswoman and enjoy skiing in the winters and riding my bike and fishing in the summers.,"From my roots, I am an avid outdoorswoman who enjoys skiing in the winters and riding my bike and fishing in the summers.","Explanation of the changes:

1. ""From grass-roots"" was changed to ""From my roots"": The phrase ""grass-roots"" usually refers to a basic, foundational level, often used in the context of movements or organizations, and doesn't quite fit here. ""From my roots"" is clearer and more personal, indicating her background or fundamental nature.

2. Added ""who"": This connects the clause describing her as an outdoorswoman to the activities she enjoys, making the sentence flow better and read more naturally.

These changes help clarify the sentence, improving readability and personalizing her connection to the outdoors."
1106,From grass-roots I am an avid outdoorswoman and enjoy skiing in the winters and riding my bike and fishing in the summers.,"From my grassroots beginnings, I have been an avid outdoor enthusiast who enjoys skiing in the winters and biking and fishing in the summers.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **""From grass-roots"" to ""From my grassroots beginnings"":** I adjusted the phrase for clarity and grammatical correctness. ""Grassroots"" is typically used as a noun or adjective, so adding ""my"" and ""beginnings"" helps establish it as a part of his personal history.

2. **""avid outdoorswoman"" to ""avid outdoor enthusiast"":** Since your friend uses he/him pronouns, ""outdoorswoman"" was not an appropriate term. ""Outdoor enthusiast"" is gender-neutral and conveys the same meaning.

3. **Structural Changes:** I added ""who"" to connect ""avid outdoor enthusiast"" with the activities he enjoys, creating a more fluid sentence structure. 

4. **""riding my bike"" to ""biking"":** This change simplifies the sentence by using a more concise term, keeping the parallel structure consistent with the other activities mentioned."
1107,From grass-roots I am an avid outdoorswoman and enjoy skiing in the winters and riding my bike and fishing in the summers.,I am a passionate outdoorswoman who enjoys skiing in the winter and biking and fishing in the summer.,"Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Simplified ""grass-roots"":** The phrase ""from grass-roots"" is somewhat unclear in this context. It typically refers to being involved in fundamental or basic levels of something, which might not be the intended meaning here. By removing it, the sentence becomes clearer and more straightforward.

2. **Added ""passionate"":** Replacing ""avid"" with ""passionate"" provides a stronger emotional tone and helps convey enthusiasm for outdoor activities.

3. **Corrected ""winters"" and ""summers"" to singular:** ""Winter"" and ""summer"" are more suited here because you are referring to activities typically done in those respective seasons generally, not multiple winters or summers.

4. **Parallel structure:** The sentence follows a parallel structure by using consistent verb forms (""skiing,"" ""biking,"" ""fishing"") that clearly outline the activities enjoyed in different seasons.

These changes help create a more concise and engaging description."
1108,From grass-roots I am an avid outdoorswoman and enjoy skiing in the winters and riding my bike and fishing in the summers.,"Since childhood, I have been an avid outdoorswoman who enjoys skiing in the winter and riding my bike and fishing in the summer.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **""From grass-roots"" to ""Since childhood"":** The phrase ""from grass-roots"" is more commonly used in the context of organizations or movements and can be unclear in this context. ""Since childhood"" effectively conveys that the interest in outdoor activities started early in life.

2. **Consistency in Seasons (""winter"" and ""summer""):** I corrected ""winters"" to ""winter"" and ""summers"" to ""summer"" for consistency, since these are generally referred to in the singular when discussing regular activities in those seasons.

3. **Structural Clarity:** Rewording the sentence structure helps it flow better and clearly separate the winter and summer activities, making the list of activities easier to read.

These changes aim to enhance clarity and ensure the sentence flows smoothly, while maintaining the original meaning."
1109,From grass-roots I am an avid outdoorswoman and enjoy skiing in the winters and riding my bike and fishing in the summers.,"From my grassroots beginnings, I am an avid outdoorswoman who enjoys skiing in the winter and fishing or riding my bike in the summer.","Explanation of changes:

1. **""From grass-roots"" to ""From my grassroots beginnings""**: Adding ""my"" and ""beginnings"" clarifies that the subject's interest in outdoor activities has been long-standing. ""My"" personalizes the experience, and ""beginnings"" provides context for the lifelong passion.

2. **""winters"" to ""winter"" and ""summers"" to ""summer""**: Changing these to singular form helps streamline the sentence, making it more concise and focused on the general concept of seasons rather than suggesting multiple instances of them.

3. **Reordering activities**: I changed ""riding my bike and fishing"" to ""fishing or riding my bike"" to provide better rhythm and parallel structure. Grouping these activities with an ""or"" gives a clearer distinction between the two, suggesting they are separate options for summertime activities. 

These changes help to enhance clarity and rhythm, making the sentence more engaging for readers."
1110,"I am a creator, a designer, and an avid outdoorsperson.","I am a creator, designer, and avid outdoorsperson.","Explanation of the change:**
- The conjunction ""and"" is typically used to link the last two items in a series. In this case, since ""designer"" and ""avid outdoorsperson"" are the final two elements in the list, it's not necessary to have an article (""a"") before each noun when they are part of a similar category (personal roles or identities in this case). By removing the articles before ""designer"" and ""avid outdoorsperson,"" the sentence becomes more streamlined without losing its meaning or impact. However, it's important to keep ""an"" before ""avid outdoorsperson"" because ""avid"" begins with a vowel sound, maintaining grammatical correctness."

These are stylistic enhancements, and the original sentence was already quite effective. The changes aim to make the sentence a little more vivid and engaging."
1112,"I am a creator, a designer, and an avid outdoorsperson.","I am a creator, a designer, and an avid outdoors enthusiast.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Outdoorsperson to Outdoors Enthusiast:** 
   - While ""outdoorsperson"" is a perfectly valid term, ""outdoors enthusiast"" might convey a slightly broader and more passionate involvement with outdoor activities. ""Enthusiast"" suggests a deep interest and enjoyment of the outdoors.

The original sentence is strong, so this change is more about nuance than fixing any major issues. Ultimately, the choice depends on the tone and style your friend prefers for her 'About Me' page."
1113,"I am a creator, a designer, and an avid outdoorsperson.","I am a creator, a designer, and an avid outdoor enthusiast.","Explanation of Changes:**

2. **""I am also""**: The use of ""also"" connects this part of the sentence to the earlier statement, suggesting a multifaceted personality.

2. **Addition of ""who"":** This adds a natural pause and makes the sentence flow better, clearly connecting her identity to her interests.

3. **Comma after ""boating"":** A comma is added after ""boating"" to separate the list of activities for clarity. Including commas between all items in a series is standard in English usage (Oxford comma), ensuring each item is distinctly recognized.

1. **Parallel Structure:** The original sentence had a mix of gerunds (surfing, snowboarding), a noun (outdoorsperson), and a verb phrase (hanging out), which resulted in inconsistent structure. To create a parallel structure, I've used gerunds or gerund phrases for each activity: ""going,"" ""surfing,"" ""snowboarding,"" ""cooking,"" ""spending time outdoors,"" and ""hanging out"".

2. **Word Choice Correction:** ""Outdoorsperson"" was changed to ""spending time outdoors."" The term ""outdoorsperson"" refers to someone who is skilled or spends a lot of time in outdoor activities, but it didn't fit the parallel structure.

3. **Typographical Corrections:** ""w"" was changed to ""with"" for clarity and formality appropriate for an 'About Me' page.

By implementing these changes, the sentence now flows more smoothly and maintains a consistent format."

4. **Changed ""w"" to ""with""**: While ""w"" is often used as an abbreviation, using ""with"" is more appropriate in formal writing.

5. **Inserted commas to separate items in the list**: Commas are used to clearly separate each item in the list, making it easier to read.

By making these changes, the sentence becomes clearer and more formal, which is appropriate for an ""About Me"" page."

1. **Parallel Structure**: The original sentence lacked parallel structure by including ""outdoorsperson,"" which is a noun, among a list of verb phrases. I adjusted the sentence to use a verb phrase ""enjoying the outdoors"" to maintain consistency with the other activities.

2. **Full Word ""with""**: The original sentence used an informal abbreviation ""w"" for ""with."" It's more formal and clear to write out ""with.""

3. **Comma Usage**: The placement of commas makes the sentence easier to read. Commas are used to separate items in a list, adding clarity.

4. **Smooth Flow**: Reorganizing the activities ensures the sentence flows smoothly and makes logical sense. 

These changes make the sentence clearer, more professional, and easier to read while maintaining its original meaning."

1. **""In my personal time"" to ""In my free time"":** The phrase ""free time"" is more commonly used and sounds more natural in conversational contexts.

2. **Parallel Structure:** The original sentence lacked parallel structure. Ensuring that all activities are listed in a similar grammatical form enhances clarity.

1. **Parallel Structure:** Ensured all activities are parallel in form by using verbs ending in ""-ing"" (gerunds). This makes the sentence smoother and easier to read. ""Enjoying the outdoors"" replaces ""outdoorsperson"" to maintain the parallel structure and clarify that it's an activity, not a noun describing a person.

2. **Clarity:** Changed ""outdoorsperson"" to ""enjoying the outdoors"" for clarity. ""Outdoorsperson"" is a noun, which was inconsistent with the activities listed. The revised phrase fits better contextually with the other activities.

1. **""In my personal time"" to ""In my free time""**: ""Free time"" is a more commonly used phrase to describe leisure time.

2. **List Consistency**: Consistency is important within lists; each activity should have the same grammatical structure (parallelism). 

3. **""Outdoorsman"" to ""spending time outdoors""**: ""Outdoorsman"" is a noun referring to a person skilled at outdoor activities, whereas the rest of the list items were in verb form (""-ing"" form). Changing it to ""spending time outdoors"" maintains grammatical consistency and fits better with the action-oriented nature of the list.

4. **""w"" to ""with""**: Spelling out ""with"" instead of using ""w"" makes the sentence more formal and avoids text-like shorthand that is inappropriate for an 'About Me' page."

2. **Correct Word Usage:** Use ""spending time outdoors"" instead of ""outdoorsman"" because ""outdoorsman"" is a noun describing a person who engages in outdoor activities, while the other items in the list are activities.

3. **Spelling Correction:** Change ""w"" to ""with"" to ensure the text is professional and clear, avoiding informal abbreviations.

4. **Comma Usage:** Ensure proper punctuation by separating items in the list with commas for clarity and readability.

1. **Parallel Structure**: The original list of activities wasn't grammatically parallel. It included noun forms (""outdoorsman"") mixed with gerunds (verb forms ending in -ing like ""surfing""). I changed ""outdoorsman"" to ""spending time outdoors"" to maintain a consistent verb form throughout the list.

2. **Spelling and Word Choice**: Changed ""w"" to ""with"" for clarity and to maintain a more formal tone. Also, ""outdoorsman"" was not correctly aligned with the context as a noun amid actions, hence the restructuring around outdoor activities.

1191,"In my personal time, I love going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, outdoorswoman, hanging out w my family and friends.","In my personal time, I love going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, enjoying the outdoors, and spending time with my family and friends.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Parallel Structure**: The original sentence listed activities in a mix of verbs and nouns (e.g., ""cooking"" and ""outdoorswoman""). I changed ""outdoorswoman"" to ""enjoying the outdoors"" to maintain consistency with the gerund form (""-ing"" form) used in the other activities.

2. **Spelling and Formatting**: Changed ""w"" to ""with"" for clarity and formality, appropriate for an 'About Me' page.

3. **Added Clarity**: I replaced ""hanging out"" with ""spending time"" to give a more polished and versatile tone, suitable for different audiences.

These changes help make the sentence clear, consistent, and readers can easily understand the list of interests."
1192,"In my personal time, I love going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, outdoorswoman, hanging out w my family and friends.","During my personal time, I love going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, spending time outdoors, and hanging out with my family and friends.","Changes Made:**

1. **""In my personal time"" to ""During my personal time"":** The phrase ""during my personal time"" sounds slightly more formal and fluid.

2. **Listed Activities:**
   - Adding ""spending time"" before ""outdoorswoman"" for clarity, as ""outdoorswoman"" is a noun. The original structure could be confusing or take away from the flow of the sentence.
  
3. **""w"" to ""with"":** Using ""with"" instead of the abbreviation ""w"" ensures the sentence is more formal and appropriate for an 'About Me' page.

These changes improve the readability and formality of the sentence, making it more suitable for an 'About Me' page."
1193,"In my personal time, I love going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, outdoorswoman, hanging out w my family and friends.","In my personal time, I love going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, spending time outdoors, and hanging out with my family and friends.","Explanation of Changes:

1. **Consistency in Verb Form**: The activities listed should have a consistent grammatical format. I've changed ""outdoorswoman"" to ""spending time outdoors"" to maintain a consistent verb phrase format (""going,"" ""surfing,"" ""snowboarding,"" ""cooking,"" ""spending,"" ""hanging"").

2. **Clarity**: The word ""outdoorswoman"" is typically used as a noun to describe a woman who enjoys outdoor activities. Since your friend is a man, this term doesn't apply here. Instead, ""spending time outdoors"" accurately describes the activity.

3. **Formal Language**: Changed ""hanging out w"" to ""hanging out with"" to maintain a formal tone appropriate for an 'About Me' page. Abbreviations like ""w"" should be fully written out in formal writing.

4. **Oxford Comma**: Although not mandatory, an Oxford comma before ""and"" in lists is often used to avoid ambiguity. However, if you prefer a style without it or a specific guideline advises against it, this can be omitted."
1194,"In my personal time, I love going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, outdoorswoman, hanging out w my family and friends.","In my personal time, I love going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, spending time outdoors, and hanging out with my family and friends.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Parallel Structure**: I adjusted the list items so they follow a similar grammatical structure, which adds clarity and flow to the sentence. Each activity is expressed as a verb or verb phrase.

2. **""Outdoorswoman""**: The term ""outdoorswoman"" was changed to ""spending time outdoors"" to fit the parallel structure and be more inclusive, aligning better with your friend's use of ""they/them"" pronouns.

3. **Avoiding Abbreviations**: ""w"" was changed to ""with"" to maintain a more formal and polished tone which is suitable for an 'About Me' page. While abbreviations may be fine in casual writing, full words are generally preferable in more formal contexts.

4. **Comma Use**: I added a comma after each activity in the list to clearly separate them.

These adjustments help maintain a more consistent and professional tone while aligning with your friend's use of gender-neutral language."
1195,"In my personal time, I love going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, outdoorswoman, hanging out w my family and friends.","In my personal time, I love going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, embracing my role as an outdoorswoman, and hanging out with my family and friends.","Changes and Explanations:**

1. **Parallel Structure**: 
   - The original list included both activities and a noun, ""outdoorswoman,"" which disrupted the parallel structure. To maintain consistency, I rephrased it as ""embracing my role as an outdoorswoman,"" turning it into an activity or interest like the others.

2. **Spelling and Formality**: 
   - ""w"" was changed to ""with"" for proper spelling and formality. It's important to use complete words in formal writing.

3. **Comma Usage**:
   - Added a comma after ""friends"" to appropriately separate the final item in the list according to standard convention for a series (known as the Oxford comma, though its use can be stylistic or based on the guidelines being followed).

The revised sentence now has a consistent style and correct grammar, making it clearer and more professional for an 'About Me' page."
1196,"In my personal time, I love going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, outdoorswoman, hanging out w my family and friends.","In my personal time, I love going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, spending time outdoors, and hanging out with my family and friends.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Parallel Structure**: The sentence has been adjusted to use a parallel structure for the list of activities. This means each item in the list follows the same grammatical form, which enhances readability and clarity.
   
2. **Replacing ""outdoorswoman""**: The term ""outdoorswoman"" was replaced with ""spending time outdoors"" to maintain consistency in the list. The original term referred to a person, not an activity, and also did not match the pronouns he/him.

3. **Spelling Out Abbreviations**: ""w"" was changed to ""with"" for proper grammar and formality.

4. **Use of Commas**: Commas are used to separate items in a list for better readability and to clearly denote individual interests.

By making these changes, the sentence is now clearer and maintains a consistent and professional tone."
1197,"In my personal time, I love going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, outdoorswoman, hanging out w my family and friends.","In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, spending time outdoors, and hanging out with my family and friends.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **""In my personal time"" to ""In my free time"":** Though ""personal time"" is not incorrect, ""free time"" is a more commonly used phrase that better conveys leisure activities.

2. **Parallel Structure:** The list of activities originally lacked parallel structure. Each item in a list should follow the same grammatical pattern. Thus, I changed ""outdoorswoman"" (a noun) to ""spending time outdoors"" (a verb phrase) so it matches the gerund form used with the other activities (i.e., ""going,"" ""surfing,"" ""snowboarding,"" ""cooking,"" ""hanging out"").

3. **""w"" to ""with"":** The abbreviation ""w"" was replaced with the full word ""with"" for greater clarity and formality, as abbreviations are generally avoided in formal writing.

4. **Comma Usage:** Added a comma before ""and"" for clarity, as recommended in the Oxford comma style, which provides clearer separation of items in a list. While its use is optional, many prefer it for preventing ambiguity."
1198,"In my personal time, I love going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, outdoorswoman, hanging out w my family and friends.","In my personal time, I love going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, spending time outdoors, and hanging out with my family and friends.","Explanation of Changes:
1. **Parallel Structure**: The activities listed should have a parallel structure (same grammatical form). ""Outdoorswoman"" was changed to ""spending time outdoors"" to maintain consistency, as it did not fit with the other activities structurally (the other items are gerunds or participial phrases).

2. **Consistent Verb Forms**: Ensured that all activities started with gerund forms (e.g., ""going,"" ""surfing,"" ""snowboarding,"" etc.).

3. **Spelling Out Words**: Changed ""w"" to ""with"" for formality and clarity.

4. **Comma Usage**: Added a comma before ""and"" to properly separate the items in the list.

These modifications improve readability and ensure the list is grammatically parallel, making the sentence more polished and easier to read."
1199,"In my personal time, I love going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, outdoorswoman, hanging out w my family and friends.","In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, surfing, snowboarding, cooking, spending time outdoors, and hanging out with my family and friends.","Explanation of changes:**

1. ""In my personal time"" was changed to ""In my free time"" – ""Free time"" is a more common expression that conveys leisure or personal time.

2. ""Outdoorswoman"" was changed to ""spending time outdoors"" – The original phrasing was inconsistent with the rest of the list, which includes activities rather than descriptions of identity or roles. ""Spending time outdoors"" flows better in a list of activities.

3. ""w"" was changed to ""with"" – This correction ensures the sentence uses proper English instead of texting shorthand.

4. Consistent use of commas was retained – Since this is a simple list, the comma usage is appropriate, leading to a polished and structured sentence."

1323,"So as an avid outdoorsperson, why wouldn't I want my children to have the greatest classroom experiences available!","As an avid outdoorsman, I want my children to have the greatest educational experiences available.","Explanation of the Changes:

1. **""Outdoorsman"" vs. ""Outdoorsperson"":** 
   - The word ""outdoorsman"" is more traditionally used for men who are enthusiastic about outdoor activities. However, ""outdoorsperson"" is gender-neutral. Since your friend is a man, ""outdoorsman"" may be more fitting, but ""outdoor enthusiast"" is another inclusive option that could work.

2. **Removing the Question Structure:**
   - The original sentence is structured as a rhetorical question, which might create confusion. It's often clearer to make direct statements, especially when the purpose is to convey personal interests and goals.

3. **""Educational experiences"" vs. ""Classroom experiences"":**
   - ""Educational experiences"" is broader and encompasses all types of learning, not just those that happen within the confines of a classroom. This aligns with the idea of learning in varied environments, which someone who enjoys the outdoors might value.

Each item (""a runner,"" ""a yogi,"" etc.) was already consistently structured, so no change was needed here. The change to ""an outdoor enthusiast"" maintains this parallel structure.

1. **Outdoorsman**: Since your friend identifies as a man, ""outdoorsman"" is more specific and traditional for describing a male who enjoys outdoor activities. If he prefers a more gender-neutral term, ""outdoorsperson"" could be used, but ""outdoorsman"" is common for individuals who self-identify in that way.

2. **Deep appreciation**: ""Deep appreciation"" is a more formal and engaging way of expressing a strong fondness compared to ""adoration residing.""

3. **Activities such as**: This phrase introduces the list more clearly and formally.

4. **Backcountry (correct usage and styling)**: The term ""backcountry"" was previously written as both ""back country"" and ""backcountry."" For consistency and correctness, ""backcountry"" is the proper styling.

1. **Clarity in List**: The original sentence lists a range of activities, but the distinction between some could be made clearer. Writing ""back country and downhill skiing"" might confuse the reader because it is unclear if ""back country"" is an activity or meant to be combined with skiing. By saying ""backcountry skiing, downhill skiing,"" it becomes clear that you mean two types of skiing.

2. **Consistency**: For consistency, I've used ""backcountry"" instead of ""back country"" to follow standard usage, giving the sentence a more polished appearance.

3. **Improved Flow**: The revised sentence has a smoother flow by explicitly linking activities with a clearer structure, making it easier to follow the list of hobbies.

2. **Removed 'with my adoration residing':** I've replaced this phrase with ""with a passion for"" to make the sentence more direct and engaging.

1435,"I am an avid outdoorswoman, with my adoration residing in the backcountry; backpacking, back country and downhill skiing, fly fishing, trekking and mountaineering to name a few.","I am an avid outdoorswoman with a deep love for the backcountry, where I enjoy activities such as backpacking, backcountry and downhill skiing, fly fishing, trekking, and mountaineering, to name a few.","Explanation of the changes:**

1. **Removed the comma after 'outdoorswoman':** The original comma creates an unnecessary pause that interrupts the natural flow of the sentence. 

2. **Changed 'with my adoration residing in the backcountry' to 'with a deep love for the backcountry':** This rephrasing makes the sentiment more direct and clear. The phrase ""a deep love for the backcountry"" is more concise and impactful.

3. **Replaced the semicolon with a comma:** Using a semicolon to list activities isn't necessary here, as the introductory phrase ""where I enjoy activities such as"" provides a smooth transition into the list.

4. **Added 'such as' before listing activities:** This addition clarifies that the activities mentioned are examples and not a comprehensive list, improving the sentence flow.

These changes enhance the clarity, readability, and overall expression of the sentence."
1436,"I am an avid outdoorswoman, with my adoration residing in the backcountry; backpacking, back country and downhill skiing, fly fishing, trekking and mountaineering to name a few.","I am an avid outdoor enthusiast with a passion for backcountry adventures, including backpacking, backcountry and downhill skiing, fly fishing, trekking, and mountaineering.","Explanation of Changes:
1. **""Outdoorswoman"" to ""outdoor enthusiast"":** The original term ""outdoorswoman"" is gender-specific and does not align with he/him pronouns. ""Outdoor enthusiast"" is a gender-neutral term that fits better with the pronouns provided.

1. **Removed ""with my adoration residing in the backcountry""**: This phrase is a bit awkward and personifies the word ""adoration"" unnecessarily. By simplifying it to ""with a passion for backcountry adventures,"" the sentence flows more naturally and directly communicates the subject's interest.

2. **Simplified list with consistent format**: I placed ""backcountry and downhill skiing"" together and adjusted punctuation for clarity and consistency. The comma-separated list is easier to read and matches conventional list structure, particularly with a conjunction (""including"") helping to introduce the list.

3. **Comma after ""mountaineering""**: The comma before ""to name a few"" separates the list from the rest of the sentence, indicating that the list is not exhaustive without implying an abrupt end."
1438,"I am an avid outdoorswoman, with my adoration residing in the backcountry; backpacking, back country and downhill skiing, fly fishing, trekking and mountaineering to name a few.","I am an avid outdoorswoman with a passion for backcountry adventures, including backpacking, backcountry and downhill skiing, fly fishing, trekking, and mountaineering, among others.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Removed the comma after ""outdoorswoman""**: The comma is unnecessary here, as it separates the subject from the verb phrase, which can disrupt the flow of the sentence.

2. **Replaced ""adoration residing in"" with ""a passion for""**: ""Passion"" is a more direct and commonly used term in this context, making the sentence clearer and more natural.

3. **Simplified Punctuation**: Combined the two separate descriptive sections into one cohesive list by using commas. This improves readability.

4. **Corrected ""back country"" to ""backcountry""**: ""Backcountry"" is one word, which consistently maintains the usage within the list.

5. **Changed ""to name a few"" to ""among others""**: This phrase maintains the informal tone but is slightly more fluid and precise in listing examples.

4. **Corrected ""back country"" to ""backcountry""**: Consistency in terminology is important. ""Backcountry"" is typically written as one word when referring to remote, undeveloped areas.

5. **Added comma before ""to name a few""**: Placing a comma here improves the flow and separates the clause from the list more clearly."

The revised sentence places ""I"" immediately after the introductory phrase to directly connect the subject with their attributes and actions.

2. **Verb Use:** The verb ""channel"" is used instead of ""goes,"" which provides a more active and intentional sense of the action described.

3. **Active Voice**: The revised sentence uses ""I channel,"" making it more active than ""goes directly into,"" which strengthens the connection between the subject and their actions.

2. **Added 'am' before 'proud':** The sentence needs a verb linking the subject ""I"" to the adjective ""proud."" The word ""am"" is the correct form to use here for proper grammatical structure.

3. **Added a hyphen in 'on-call':** The term ""on-call"" is typically hyphenated when used as an adjective preceding a noun. This helps clarify that ""on-call"" is modifying ""fireman."
1844,I absolutely love my Town and also proud to serve my community as an on call fireman.,I absolutely love my town and am also proud to serve my community as an on-call firefighter.,"Explanation of changes:

3. **Hyphenated 'on-call':** When used as a compound modifier before a noun, ""on-call"" should be hyphenated.

4. **Gender-neutral term 'firefighter':** Since your friend uses they/them pronouns, I've replaced ""fireman"" with the gender-neutral term ""firefighter"" to better align with their identity."
1845,I absolutely love my Town and also proud to serve my community as an on call fireman.,The sentence can be improved for clarity and consistency with the following changes,"1. Capitalization: The word ""Town"" does not need to be capitalized unless it is part of a proper noun (e.g., the name of the town). If ""Town"" is not a proper noun, it should be lowercase.

2. Pronoun Usage: Since your friend uses she/her pronouns, it's more inclusive and accurate to use ""firefighter"" instead of ""fireman.""

3. Structure and Clarity: The conjunction ""and"" needs to connect two clauses of similar structure, so adding ""am"" after ""also"" provides clarity and parallel structure to the sentence.

Explanation:
- ""town"" is lowercase assuming it's not part of a proper noun.

2111,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a fireman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a catalyst, and a firefighter.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Catalyst**: The word ""firestarter"" can be interpreted in a literal sense or metaphorically. If the intent is metaphorical—someone who initiates change or action—""catalyst"" is a clearer and more commonly understood term for this role.

2. **Firefighter**: The term ""fireman"" is gender-specific and usually refers to male firefighters. ""Firefighter"" is a gender-neutral term that includes everyone in the profession, making it more inclusive, especially important for respecting and reflecting nonbinary identity."
2112,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a fireman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a trailblazer, and a firefighter.","1. **Consistency in Noun Form**: 
   - Changed ""fireman"" to ""firefighter"" to ensure gender inclusivity and precision. ""Firefighter"" is a gender-neutral term that is widely accepted and represents what is typically understood by the colloquial ""fireman.""
   
2. **Clarity and Contemporary Language**: 
   - Replaced ""firestarter"" with ""trailblazer."" While ""firestarter"" has a literal meaning, it's more commonly associated with the act of starting fires, but metaphorically it might not clearly convey what is intended without causing potential confusion. ""Trailblazer"" signifies someone who pioneers or is at the forefront of innovative or bold actions, which might align better with the intended metaphorical meaning. If ""firestarter"" is intended to convey someone who instigates change, ""trailblazer"" enhances the clarity of that intent.

3. **List Structure**: 
   - Added the conjunction ""and"" before ""firefighter"" for better readability and to follow standard stylistic conventions in lists.

These adjustments help clarify and modernize the expression while maintaining a strong, cohesive image of her multifaceted identity."
2113,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a fireman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, and a firefighter.","Explanation of Changes:

1. **Fireman to Firefighter**: The term ""firefighter"" is more inclusive and modern compared to ""fireman,"" which traditionally refers to male firefighters. Using ""firefighter"" ensures your friend’s statement is gender-neutral and universally understandable.

2. **Added 'and'**: Adding ""and"" before the last item in a list is grammatically correct in English, especially in formal writing. This follows the Oxford comma rule, which can enhance readability and understanding by clearly delineating the final item in the list.

3. **Comma**: A comma is placed before ""and"" in lists like this, aligning with the Oxford comma usage, which helps clarify that each item is distinct. It may be optional in some styles, but it often improves clarity."
2114,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a fireman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a catalyst for change, and a firefighter.","Changes made:

1. **Inclusive Language**: Replaced ""fireman"" with ""firefighter"" to use a gender-neutral term that aligns with your friend's pronouns.
   
2. **Variety in Description**: Changed ""firestarter"" to ""catalyst for change."" This maintains the metaphorical meaning of someone who initiates change or new ideas while avoiding repetition with ""fireman/firefighter.""

These changes aim to respect your friend's pronouns and provide a varied, inclusive description of their roles and characteristics."
2115,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a fireman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a trailblazer, and a firefighter.","Explanation of changes:**

1. **Consistency in Parallel Structure**: Adding ""and"" before ""firefighter"" aligns the sentence with a consistent parallel structure, helping it to read smoothly.

2. **Inclusive Language**: Replacing ""fireman"" with ""firefighter"" uses gender-neutral language, which is broadly preferred for inclusivity and better reflects your friend's pronoun use. 

3. **Clarification of ""Firestarter""**: If ""firestarter"" is intended to mean someone who is pioneering or innovative, ""trailblazer"" may be a clearer choice, depending on the connotation your friend wishes to convey. If ""firestarter"" is meant literally, you may retain it, but consider identifying what specific quality or role it exemplifies."
2116,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a fireman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a catalyst for change, and a firefighter.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Consistency in Vocabulary:**
   - Changed ""firestarter"" to ""catalyst for change"": The term ""firestarter"" can be somewhat ambiguous and might be misinterpreted literally or suggest a negative connotation. ""Catalyst for change"" conveys an active role in creating positive transformation, which adds clarity and depth.

2. **Clarity and Precision:**
   - Changed ""fireman"" to ""firefighter"": ""Firefighter"" is a more contemporary and gender-neutral term. Although your friend uses he/him pronouns, ""firefighter"" is generally more inclusive and widely accepted.

3. **Stylistic Parallel Structure:**
   - Added ""and"" before the last item to enhance readability and follow stylistic conventions when listing items.

These changes aim to present your friend's roles and identities in a clear, cohesive, and modern manner."
2117,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a fireman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, and a firefighter.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Consistency in List Format**: Adding the word ""and"" before the last item in the list (""and a firefighter"") improves readability and follows a conventional list format, which typically includes a conjunction before the final item.
   
2. **Word Choice**: Changing ""fireman"" to ""firefighter"" is a more inclusive term and is widely used to refer to individuals in this profession without specifying gender. 

Overall, these changes enhance clarity, professionalism, and inclusivity."
2118,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a fireman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a catalyst, and a firefighter.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Parallel Structure**: Adding ""and"" before the last item (""firefighter"") improves the parallel structure, making the list clearer and easier to read.

2. **Word Choice**: 
   - ""Firestarter"" has been changed to ""catalyst."" While ""firestarter"" can imply someone who initiates action or change, it can also carry negative connotations of causing trouble or conflict. ""Catalyst,"" on the other hand, is a more neutral term that conveys the idea of facilitating change or sparking new ideas.
   - ""Fireman"" has been updated to ""firefighter"" to use more gender-neutral language, which is a more modern and inclusive term.

These changes aim to enhance clarity, maintain a positive tone, and ensure inclusivity."
2119,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a fireman.","I am a farmer, a firefighter, an ally, and a catalyst for change.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Reordering:**
   - ""Firestarter"" and ""fireman"" are closely related concepts, so I replaced ""firestarter"" with ""catalyst for change"" for clarity and placed related roles (""firefighter"" and ""catalyst for change"") together.

2. **Clarifying Terms:**
   - Replaced ""firestarter"" with ""catalyst for change"" to better convey the idea of initiating positive action or transformation. ""Firestarter"" can have negative connotations, suggesting someone who causes trouble or conflict, whereas ""catalyst for change"" emphasizes positive influence.

3. **Adding Articles and Commas:**
   - Added ""an"" before ""ally"" and ""a catalyst for change"" for consistency and a more natural flow. Commas are used to separate items in a list and improve readability.

These changes aim to enhance clarity and ensure that the sentence reflects your friend's intended roles and characteristics more effectively."
2120,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a firewoman.","I am a farmer, a devoted ally, an innovator, and a dedicated firefighter.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Farmer**: No change needed as it clearly describes your friend’s profession or lifestyle.

2. **Ally**: Added ""devoted"" to give more depth and a sense of commitment to the term ""ally."" It indicates a strong and supportive nature.

3. **Firestarter**: Changed to ""innovator."" The term ""firestarter"" can have an ambiguous or negative connotation (e.g., someone who incites trouble). ""Innovator"" maintains the positive implication of someone who sparks new ideas or initiatives.

4. **Firewoman**: Changed to ""dedicated firefighter"" for clarity and precision. ""Firewoman"" is less commonly used and ""firefighter"" is a more widely recognized term. Adding ""dedicated"" also adds a sense of commitment and professionalism.

Each revision clarifies the meaning and adds a layer of professionalism and dedication to the attributes, making the sentence more impactful and coherent."
2121,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a firewoman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, and a firefighter.","Explanation of the changes:**

1. **""Firewoman"" to ""firefighter"":** 
   - The term ""firefighter"" is gender-neutral and inclusive, making it more appropriate for describing someone who fights fires, especially for a nonbinary person. It avoids emphasizing a gender-specific role and aligns with modern, inclusive language.

2. **Added ""and"" before ""firefighter"":**
   - Adding ""and"" before the last item in a list (also known as the Oxford comma) improves readability and ensures clarity in listing the roles the person identifies with. This adjustment helps create a smoother connection between the listed identities."
2122,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a firewoman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a trailblazer, and a firefighter.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **""Trailblazer"" instead of ""firestarter"":** The term ""firestarter"" can be interpreted literally or as someone who incites trouble. ""Trailblazer"" more positively conveys the idea of someone who is pioneering and leading the way.

2. **""Firefighter"" instead of ""firewoman"":** ""Firefighter"" is more commonly used and neutral regarding gender. It emphasizes professionalism and aligns with standard terminology within firefighting professions.

3. **Added ""and"" before the last profession:** This addition improves the flow and readability of the sentence by clearly separating each role."
2123,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a firewoman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a catalyst, and a firefighter.","1. **""Firestarter"" to ""catalyst""**: While ""firestarter"" conveys someone who ignites or inspires change, it can also have negative connotations of causing trouble or chaos. ""Catalyst"" is a more universally positive term that implies triggering or accelerating progress or change.

2. **""Firewoman"" to ""firefighter""**: As your friend is a man, ""firewoman"" might not be the appropriate term. ""Firefighter"" is a gender-neutral term that describes a person whose job is to extinguish fires or rescue people.

3. **Added ""and"" before ""firefighter""**: Adding ""and"" improves the flow and structure of the sentence, making it clear that it's a list of attributes or roles."
2124,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a firewoman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a firefighter.","Explanation of Changes:
1. **Firewoman to Firefighter**: The term ""firewoman"" is gender-specific. Replacing it with ""firefighter"" makes it gender-neutral, aligning with the use of they/them pronouns and promoting inclusivity.
2. **Repetition of Article 'a':** In this structure, repeating the article ""a"" helps in the rhythm of the sentence and emphasizes each aspect of their identity. However, this was correct initially, so no further change was required here.

This revision maintains clarity and inclusivity while respecting your friend's pronouns."
2125,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a firewoman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a trailblazer, and a firefighter.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **""Firestarter"" to ""Trailblazer"":** 
   - The term ""firestarter"" can imply someone who literally starts fires, which might not be what your friend intends. If the idea is to convey innovation or leadership, ""trailblazer"" is a widely recognized term for someone who is pioneering and initiates new paths or ideas.

2. **""Firewoman"" to ""Firefighter"":**
   - ""Firefighter"" is the standard non-gendered professional term used for individuals who work in fire services. If your friend wants to emphasize her gender in this role, using ""firefighter"" still maintains professionalism and clarity while implying inclusivity.

3. **Added ""and"" before the last noun:**
   - Adding ""and"" before the last item in a list clarifies the structure and adds a natural pause for better readability."
2126,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a firewoman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, and a firefighter.","Changes Made:**

1. **Consistency in Role Terminology:** 
   - The term ""firewoman"" was changed to ""firefighter."" This change maintains consistency with your friend's pronouns and is a more gender-neutral term that can be used regardless of how your friend identifies.
   
2. **Parallel Structure and Clarity:**
   - The word ""and"" was added before the last item to improve sentence flow and readability, ensuring a clear, parallel list structure.

These adjustments maintain the essence of your friend's self-description while ensuring clarity and inclusivity."
2127,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a firewoman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a catalyst, and a firefighter.","Explanation of Changes Made:**

1. **Parallel Structure:** Added ""and"" before ""firefighter"" to maintain parallel structure, which helps improve readability.

2. **Word Choice:**
   - Changed ""firestarter"" to ""catalyst"" to convey the idea of someone who initiates change or inspires action in a positive sense. ""Firestarter"" can have connotations of someone causing trouble or starting literal fires, which may not align with the intended message.
   - Changed ""firewoman"" to ""firefighter"" for inclusivity and accuracy. ""Firefighter"" is a gender-neutral term that appropriately describes the profession of someone who extinguishes fires and performs rescues. If being a ""firewoman"" is an important part of her identity, and she wants to maintain that phrasing, it's perfectly okay to keep it as it was.

These changes aim to clarify the roles and intentions described while making the sentence flow smoothly."
2128,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a firewoman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, and a firefighter.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Firestarter vs. Firewoman**: 
   - The term ""firestarter"" suggests someone who initiates change or ignites passion or excitement. If this is the intended meaning, it makes sense to keep. 
   - The term ""firewoman"" seems intended to mean a female firefighter, but ""firefighter"" is the more commonly used term for both male and female fire personnel. If it's meant in the context of being a firefighter, using ""firefighter"" maintains clarity and is more inclusive.

2. **Use of ""and"":**
   - Adding ""and"" before the last item in the list (""firefighter"") follows conventional grammatical structure for lists, which includes a conjunction before the final item. This enhances the rhythm and flow of the sentence.

These adjustments maintain the original meaning while ensuring clarity and grammatical accuracy."
2129,"I am a farmer, an ally, a firestarter, a firewoman.","I am a farmer, an ally, a trailblazer, and a firewoman.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Parallel Structure:** The original sentence lists attributes but lacks coordination in word choice. ""Firestarter"" and ""firewoman"" might be intended to convey different aspects of the person's character or profession. To maintain clarity and ensure consistency, it's essential to use terms that align with the intended meanings.

2. **Word Choice:** 
   - ""Firestarter"" could be interpreted as a metaphor for someone who initiates change or excitement. However, to avoid any potential negative connotations (since 'firestarter' might also imply starting literal fires), ""trailblazer"" is suggested. It retains the positive connotation of innovation and leadership.
   - Kept ""firewoman,"" assuming it refers to her being involved in firefighting or related activities.

3. **Conjunction Usage:** Adding ""and"" before the last item in a list is a standard practice to complete the list fully and naturally, improving the sentence's flow."
2130,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a firefighter on the helicopter squad.","I have also been a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter in the helicopter squad.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Parallel Structure**: The sentence was modified to have a clearer parallel structure. This helps in maintaining consistency and readability, especially when listing occupations or experiences.
   
2. **Removal of Redundant Words**: The second ""also"" was removed because it is unnecessary to use it more than once in this context.
   
3. **Consistency in Prepositions**: Changed ""on the helicopter squad"" to ""in the helicopter squad"" for consistency and to convey the correct relationship or membership as part of a team."
2131,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a firefighter on the helicopter squad.","I have also been a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter on the helicopter squad.","Changes and explanations: 

1. **Verb Tense Consistency**: Changed ""was"" to ""have been"" to maintain consistency with the present perfect tense, which typically sounds more polished and is often used to discuss past experiences that are relevant to the present.

2. **Word Choice and Hyphenation**: Changed ""polar bear-guard"" to ""polar bear guard"" for clarity and correct usage unless ""polar bear-guard"" is a specific term; typically, hyphenation isn't needed here as ""polar bear guard"" is clear as a compound noun.

3. **Redundancy**: Removed the second ""also"" for improved readability and flow; using ""also"" once at the beginning of the sentence is sufficient to convey the idea of additional experiences. 

4. **Parallel Structure**: Added a comma after ""controller"" to separate the items in the list and maintain parallel structure, enhancing the sentence's readability.

These changes aim to improve clarity, readability, and grammatical correctness."
2132,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a firefighter on the helicopter squad.","I have also served as a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter with the helicopter squad.","Changes Made and Explanation:

1. **Consistency in Tense:** Replaced ""was"" with ""have"" to maintain consistent tense usage with ""also,"" implying these were past activities without specifying a single event. This presents the roles as part of her broader range of experiences.

2. **Redundant Use of ""Also"":** Removed one instance of ""also"" to eliminate redundancy and improve flow. Using ""also"" twice in close succession can be repetitive, so using it once effectively conveys that these are in addition to the primary narrative.

3. **Parallel Structure:** Maintained a consistent structure in the list of roles, which aids clarity and readability. Using articles (""a"" and ""a"") with each position helps keep the list grammatically parallel.

4. **Clarity in Roles:** Adjusted ""on the helicopter squad"" to ""with the helicopter squad"" to clarify the association with the squad, adding coherence to the list of roles.

These changes collectively enhance the sentence's readability, clarity, and grammatical structure."
2133,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a firefighter on the helicopter squad.","I have also served as a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter in a helicopter squad.","Explanation of Changes:
1. **Removed Redundancy**: The second ""also"" was removed because it is redundant to use it twice in the same sentence.

2. **Verb Consistency**: Changed ""was"" to ""have served as"" to maintain a consistent and formal tone while emphasizing past roles that might still hold significance.

3. **Clarification and Consistency**: The phrase ""in a helicopter squad"" is more precise than ""on the helicopter squad"" and aligns better with how teams or units are typically referred to. 

These changes make the sentence more concise, clear, and grammatically consistent."
2134,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a firefighter on the helicopter squad.","I have also served as a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter on the helicopter squad.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Consistency in Verb Tense**: Changed ""was"" to ""have"" to use the present perfect tense, which emphasizes past experiences relevant to the present. This is often used in 'About Me' sections to convey ongoing relevance.

2. **Redundancy**: Removed the second ""also"" to avoid repetition. The word ""also"" is used once to summarize the various roles succinctly.

3. **Hyphenation**: Changed ""polar bear-guard"" to ""polar bear guard"" because, in this context, ""polar bear"" functions as a compound adjective for ""guard,"" so a hyphen is unnecessary.

These changes streamline the sentence and improve clarity, making it easier for the reader to understand the range of experiences your friend has had."
2135,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a firefighter on the helicopter squad.","I have also been a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter with the helicopter squad.","Explanation of Changes:

1. **Verb Tense Consistency:**  
   Changed ""was"" to ""have been"" to maintain a consistent present-perfect tense. This emphasizes her ongoing experience and implies that these roles are part of her past without specifying when they occurred.

2. **Removed Redundancy:**  
   The second ""also"" was removed for conciseness. Repeated use of ""also"" can be redundant. Starting the sentence with ""I have also been"" adequately conveys her diverse experiences.

3. **Clarified Job Titles:**  
   Added a hyphen in ""polar bear guard"" to clarify the term. Although ""polar bear guard"" is not a standard term, the hyphen helps show it as a combined noun.

4. **Improved Parallel Structure:**  
   Changed ""on the helicopter squad"" to ""with the helicopter squad"" for better parallelism with ""a firefighter."" Prepositions can change the nuance of a role – ""with"" suggests affiliation or involvement. 

These changes improve the clarity and readability of the sentence."
2136,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a firefighter on the helicopter squad.","I have also worked as a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter in the helicopter squad.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Consistency in Verb Tense**: Changed ""was"" to ""have"" to maintain a consistent use of the present perfect tense, which provides a sense of continuity with the writer's past experiences and makes it clear that these roles are part of his history.

2. **Removal of Repetition**: The word ""also"" was used twice in the original sentence. By using it only once, right at the beginning, the sentence becomes more concise.

3. **Clarity and Precision**: Changed ""on the helicopter squad"" to ""in the helicopter squad"" for grammatical correctness, as it is common to say ""in a squad"" when referring to being part of a team."
2137,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a firefighter on the helicopter squad.","I have also worked as a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter with the helicopter squad.","Explanation of Changes:
1. **Removed Repetition of ""also"":** The phrase ""also"" is only needed once to establish that there is more than one role being mentioned; using it more than once is unnecessary.
2. **Consistent Structure:** The use of ""as"" before listing the job titles brings a parallel structure, which improves readability.
3. **Clarification:** Changed ""firefighter on the helicopter squad"" to ""firefighter with the helicopter squad"" for clearer understanding, emphasizing that the firefighting role was specifically related to the helicopter squad."
2138,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a firefighter on the helicopter squad.","I have worked as a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter with the helicopter squad.","Explanation of the changes:

1. **Removed Redundancy**: The word ""also"" was used twice in the original sentence. Since the use of a list inherently suggests multiple roles, we only need one inclusion word (like ""also"") or no inclusion word at all for clarity.

2. **Parallel Structure**: The roles are now listed in a parallel structure, where each item is a noun phrase that fits grammatically within the sentence. This makes the sentence easier to read and understand.

3. **Clarity**: By using ""with the helicopter squad"" instead of ""on the helicopter squad,"" it clarifies the role while maintaining fluency and conciseness in the sentence."
2139,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a firefighter on the helicopter squad.","I have experience as a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter on a helicopter squad.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Removed redundancy**: The word ""also"" was used twice. Repetitive use of ""also"" is not necessary and can make the sentence feel cluttered. By removing one of them, the sentence reads more smoothly.

2. **Consistency in format**: Changed ""polar bear-guard"" to ""polar bear guard"" for better readability and consistency. Hyphens are typically used for compound adjectives or when two words function as a single idea before a noun. Here, it's more natural to use it as two separate words.

3. **Parallel structure**: Adjusted the order and structure to maintain parallel structure. This involves presenting ideas in a grammatically similar way, making it clearer and more professional.

These changes aim to make the sentence clearer, more concise, and easier to read."
2140,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a fireman on the helicopter squad.","I have also served as a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter in the helicopter squad.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Consistent Verb Tense**: I changed ""was"" to ""have"" to maintain consistency in verb tense with the use of ""have"" or ""have been"" typically being more suitable for past roles, especially if they might still be relevant to the person's identity or career narrative.

2. **Removal of Redundancy**: The second ""also"" was removed because it's unnecessary to repeat it when listing multiple items. The first ""also"" establishes that these are additional roles.

3. **Clarity and Correct Terminology**: I replaced ""fireman"" with ""firefighter"" to use a more inclusive and contemporary term. Additionally, ""firefighter in the helicopter squad"" is slightly clearer than ""fireman on the helicopter squad.""

4. **Consistent Structure**: The list maintains parallel structure, making it clearer and more professional."
2141,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a fireman on the helicopter squad.","I have also worked as a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter on the helicopter squad.","Explanation of changes:**

1. **Eliminated the Redundant 'also':** The word ""also"" was used twice in the original sentence. Using it once suffices to convey that these roles are additional to whatever was mentioned previously.

2. **Consistent Parallel Structure:** Each job title now follows a similar format (""a [role]""), creating parallel structure and making the sentence easier to read.

3. **Inclusive Language:** Changed ""fireman"" to ""firefighter"" to ensure gender-neutrality and inclusivity, which is important especially since your friend is nonbinary.

4. **Hyphenated Term:** In ""polar bear guard,"" I opted to remove the hyphen to fit standard conventions of job descriptions unless it's part of an official title, which tends to vary by context. Adjust according to specific preferences or styles."
2142,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a fireman on the helicopter squad.","I have also worked as a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter with the helicopter squad.","Explanation of changes:

1. **Repetition of ""also"":** The original sentence uses ""also"" twice, which is unnecessary. Using ""also"" once at the beginning of the list is sufficient to convey that additional information is being added.

2. **Consistency in Job Titles:** Changing ""fireman"" to ""firefighter"" provides gender-neutral language, aligning with modern usage to avoid gender-specific job titles unless relevant. This is particularly important for your friend's context, as she's a woman.

3. **Hyphen Correction:** The compound noun ""polar bear-guard"" is corrected to ""polar bear guard"" for clarity. Generally, it does not require a hyphen in this context.

4. **Parallel Structure:** ""With the helicopter squad"" clarifies the role, maintaining a parallel structure with ""polar bear guard"" and ""helicopter controller."" This keeps the sentence clear and consistent in how each job is described."
2143,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a fireman on the helicopter squad.","I have also worked as a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a fireman in the helicopter squad.","Explanation of the changes:
1. **Parallel Structure**: The list now uses a consistent grammatical structure, enhancing readability and clarity. Each job title uses the same verbal form (""worked as a"") for parallelism.
   
2. **Removal of Redundancy**: The word ""also"" is used only once at the beginning to avoid unnecessary repetition and to smooth the flow of the sentence.

3. **Preposition Adjustment**: Changed ""on the helicopter squad"" to ""in the helicopter squad"" to more accurately describe membership or association with a team."
2144,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a fireman on the helicopter squad.","I was also a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter on the helicopter squad.","Here are the changes and explanations:

1. **""Polar bear-guard"" to ""polar bear guard""**: The hyphen in ""polar bear-guard"" was removed because the term does not function as a compound adjective modifying a noun. It is meant to be a noun phrase listing a role or job title, so separating the words makes it clearer.

2. **""Fireman"" to ""firefighter""**: The term ""firefighter"" is used instead of ""fireman"" to be gender-neutral, which is especially appropriate considering your friend's use of they/them pronouns. It is also the more modern and inclusive term for this profession.

3. **Repetition of ""also""**: The second occurrence of ""also"" was removed for conciseness and improved sentence flow. It is sufficient to use ""also"" once at the beginning to indicate the additional aspects of their experiences."
2145,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a fireman on the helicopter squad.","I was a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter on the helicopter squad.","Changes Made:

1. ""also"" - The word ""also"" appeared twice in the original sentence. Using it only once suffices to indicate that the experiences are additional to other ones not listed. It sounds better to use it just once at the beginning or end of the sentence.

2. ""polar bear-guard"" - The hyphen is not necessary here since ""polar bear"" acts as an adjective to ""guard."" So, it becomes ""polar bear guard.""

3. ""fireman"" - The term ""fireman"" is somewhat outdated and gender-specific. More inclusive language would use ""firefighter,"" which does not specify gender.

4. Punctuation - Added a comma before the ""and"" in the list items, which is known as the serial comma or Oxford comma. It prevents potential ambiguity, especially in more complex lists.

The revised sentence is more concise, inclusive, and grammatically correct:  
""I was a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter on the helicopter squad."
2146,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a fireman on the helicopter squad.","I have been a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter in the helicopter squad.","Explanation of Changes:
1. **Removed Redundant Use of ""Also"":** The original sentence used ""also"" twice. Since ""also"" is intended to emphasize a continuation or addition and you're already listing past roles, it’s sufficient to mention it once at the beginning or not at all. I chose to remove it for a smoother flow.

2. **Consistent Verb Tense:** Changed ""was"" to ""have been"" for a more formal tone and consistency, which fits the context of an ""About Me"" page. It also suggests that the experience is part of an ongoing list, relevant to the person's current identity.

3. **Parallel Structure:** Adjusted the phrasing slightly to ensure a consistent parallel structure across the list items. Each role is presented clearly as a specific, distinct experience.

4. **Clarified Role Descriptions:**
   - Changed ""polar bear-guard"" to ""polar bear guard"" for clarity. Hyphenation can sometimes obscure understanding; in this case, it's clearer without.
   - Used ""firefighter"" instead of ""fireman"" to employ more modern, gender-neutral terminology. Even though ""he"" is used, it's often preferable to use language that's inclusive whenever possible. 

5. **Improved Clarity and Flow:** The restructured sentence is clearer and reads more smoothly, ensuring the different roles are easy for the reader to differentiate and understand."
2147,"I was also a polar bear-guard, a helicopter controller and also a fireman on the helicopter squad.","I have also served as a polar bear guard, a helicopter controller, and a firefighter with the helicopter squad.","Explanation of Changes:

1. **Consistency in Verb Tense:**
   - Changed ""was"" to ""have served"" to maintain tense consistency with the rest of the page if it uses present perfect when discussing past roles. This also emphasizes ongoing relevance or achievement.

2. **Elimination of Redundancy:**

3. **Word Choice**:
   - ""Began"" was used instead of ""started"" for a more formal tone.
   - ""Bustling"" replaced ""busy"" to add a more vivid description of the station environment.

4. **Active Voice and Format**:
    - The phrase ""where I handled"" emphasizes the subject's active role in dealing with policing aspects.
    - ""Helping to shape"" suggests active involvement and influence, providing a more engaging depiction of the role as a cadet training officer.

2. **Transitional Words and Phrasing:**
   - Adding ""In addition to my duties"" provides a clear transition between her policing role and her role as a cadet training officer.
   - ""Guiding"" is a stronger, more specific word than ""developing"" in the context of describing her work with teenagers.

3. **Emphasis on Passion:**
   - ""Sparked my passion"" is a more vivid way to express how her interest in developing people began.

However, if the original intention was past perfect to indicate an action completed before another past action, it can remain ""I'd.""

3. **Comma addition:** Added a serial comma after ""burglars"" to conform to standard writing style guides, enhancing clarity in lists.

This revision maintains the essence of the original sentence while ensuring it respects and reflects your friend's identity."
2502,"I’d hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars and drug dealers as a policeman.","I've hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars, and drug dealers during my career in law enforcement.","Explanation of changes:**

1. **Gender-neutral term:** The word ""policeman"" was replaced with ""during my career in law enforcement"" to avoid gender-specific language and ensure that the sentence reflects the gender identity of the person accurately.

2. **Verb tense consistency:** Changed ""I'd"" to ""I've"" for a more straightforward present perfect tense, which is often used in autobiographical contexts to describe life experiences up to the present time.

2503,"I’d hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars and drug dealers as a policeman.","As a police officer, I have tracked down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars, and drug dealers.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **""As a police officer"":** Changed ""as a policeman"" to ""as a police officer"" for gender-neutral language, which is considered more inclusive and modern in current professional settings.

2. **""have tracked down"":** Changed ""I’d hunted down"" to ""I have tracked down"" for slightly more formal and precise language. ""I have"" rather than ""I’d"" also provides clarity that you are referring to your own experiences, and ""tracked down"" is less colloquial than ""hunted down,"" which can carry a more aggressive connotation.

3. **Comma added after ""burglars"":** To improve readability with a serial list, a comma has been added before the conjunction (known as the Oxford comma), which helps ensure clarity by distinctly separating the items in the list.

These changes help make the sentence more polished and professionally coherent for an 'About Me' page."
2504,"I’d hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars and drug dealers as a policeman.","I’ve hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars, and drug dealers during my time in law enforcement.","Explanation:
1. **Removed specific gender reference (""as a policeman"")**: Using ""police officer"" or ""in law enforcement"" avoids gender-specific terms and aligns with your friend's use of they/them pronouns.
2. **Verb tense (""have hunted"")**: Changed ""I'd hunted"" to ""I've hunted"" to maintain present perfect tense, indicating ongoing relevance or recent completion of these activities.
3. **Comma consistency**: Added a comma before ""and"" in the list for consistency and to adhere to the Oxford comma style, which can clarify the separation of listed items."
2505,"I’d hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars and drug dealers as a policeman.","I worked as a police officer, where I hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars, and drug dealers.","Here are the changes and the reasoning behind them:

1. **""as a policeman"" to ""as a police officer""**: The term ""policeman"" is gender-specific. Since your friend uses she/her pronouns, it is more appropriate and inclusive to use the gender-neutral term ""police officer.""

2. **Rephrasing for clarity and active voice**: Starting the sentence with ""I worked as a police officer"" clearly sets the context and subject (your friend) up front. This active voice construction makes the sentence more direct and impactful."
2506,"I’d hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars and drug dealers as a policeman.","I worked as a policeman, where I hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars, and drug dealers.","Explanation of changes:**

1. **Subject clarity:** Moving ""as a policeman"" to the beginning clarifies the context before going into the specific actions, making it immediately clear to the reader what role he was in when performing these duties.

2. **Consistent tense usage:** The original sentence uses ""I'd,"" which stands for ""I had,"" suggesting a past perspective. Depending on the surrounding text, using ""worked"" as a simple past tense could be more straightforward unless he is specifically referring to a past perspective that requires ""I had."" If the context of the paragraph indicates that the prior work is connected to subsequent information, the past perfect ""I'd"" could remain.

3. **Comma addition:** The addition of a comma before ""and"" in the list of criminals adheres to the serial, or Oxford, comma rule, which can help avoid potential ambiguity in lists."
2507,"I’d hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars and drug dealers as a policeman.","As a police officer, I tracked down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars, and drug dealers.","Explanation of changes:

1. **Professional terminology**: ""Police officer"" is often preferred over ""policeman"" for inclusivity and modern context.

2. **Verb choice**: ""Tracked down"" is substituted for ""hunted down"" to convey a more professional and systematic approach rather than a colloquial or aggressive tone.

3. **Order of words**: Starting with ""As a police officer"" provides immediate context and sets a professional tone from the beginning.

4. **Comma use**: Adding a comma before ""and"" in a list (known as the Oxford or serial comma) improves clarity by clearly separating each element in the list, especially in longer sentences.

These changes keep the original meaning intact while improving the overall flow and professionalism of the sentence."
2508,"I’d hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars and drug dealers as a policeman.","As a police officer, I have hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars, and drug dealers.","Changes Made:

1. **""Police officer"" instead of ""policeman"":** The term ""police officer"" is gender-neutral and more inclusive compared to ""policeman.""

2. **Subject reordering for clarity:** Starting with ""As a police officer"" places the context upfront, making it immediately clear who is performing the actions.

3. **Maintaining consistent verb tense:** The original sentence starts with ""I'd,"" which typically implies a conditional or past perfect tense. However, switching to the present perfect ""I have"" suggests the experience is recent or relevant to the present, which is often the intent on an ""About Me"" page.

4. **Removal of 'down' after ""hunted"":** The word ""hunted"" effectively conveys the pursuit on its own, and while ""down"" is not incorrect, its removal makes the sentence cleaner.

These changes help provide more straightforward, engaging, and inclusive language for the ""About Me"" page."
2509,"I’d hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars and drug dealers as a policeman.","I have hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars, and drug dealers during my career as a police officer.","Explanation of changes:

2. **Clarity and Formality:** Changed ""policeman"" to ""police officer."" The latter is more gender-neutral and formal.

2510,"I’d hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars and drug dealers as a policewoman.","As a policewoman, I have hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars, and drug dealers.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Reordering Phrase for Emphasis and Clarity**: By starting the sentence with ""As a policewoman,"" the reader immediately understands the context before getting into the actions taken. This structure introduces the subject's role first, which can be more engaging.

2. **Tense Adjustment**: Changing ""I'd"" (which is a contraction of ""I had"") to ""I have"" makes the tense present perfect rather than past perfect, suggesting continuity or relevance to the present. This can make the skills and experiences described feel current and ongoing.

3. **Consistency and Parallel Structure**: Maintaining a consistent parallel structure by ensuring all items in the list are nouns (""murderers, rapists, burglars, and drug dealers"") improves readability and balance. The original had a good structure, but the revised sentence highlights this clarity further.

These changes aim to make the sentence more authoritative and engaging while maintaining its original message."

   - Changed ""I'd hunted down and arrested"" to ""I have hunted down and arrested."" The present perfect tense (""have hunted"") is used to connect past actions to the present context, suggesting that the experience continues to be relevant to the person's identity or career.

2. **Gender-neutral Language:**
   - Replaced ""as a policewoman"" with ""during my time on the police force"" to make the language more inclusive and applicable to a nonbinary person. This avoids gender-specific terms and focuses on the role rather than gender.

   - Added a comma after ""burglars"" for clarity and to follow the Oxford comma style, which is often used in formal writing to avoid potential ambiguity in a list."
2512,"I’d hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars and drug dealers as a policewoman.","As a police officer, I've tracked down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars, and drug dealers.","Explanation of changes:**

1. **""As a police officer""** - Changing ""policewoman"" to ""police officer"" makes the term more inclusive and emphasizes the role over the gender, aligning with modern preferences for gender-neutral language in professional titles.
   
2. **""I've tracked down""** - This alternative to ""I’d hunted down"" may convey a more professional tone, while ""hunted down"" can suggest a more intense, aggressive action. ""I've"" (I have) also aligns verb tense with someone narrating past experiences from the present perspective.

3. **Comma after ""burglars""** - Including this maintains the standard serial comma (also known as the Oxford comma) before ""and,"" which can clarify lists and is often preferred in formal writing.

These changes are subtle and a matter of style, aiming to present a professional tone and avoid any potential negative connotations."

1. **Verb Tense Change:** Changed ""I’d hunted down and arrested"" to ""I have pursued and apprehended."" The use of the present perfect tense (""have pursued"") makes the sentence sound more immediate and relevant, implying ongoing skills or experience rather than a completed action. ""Pursued"" and ""apprehended"" provide a more professional tone to the description of police work.
   
2. **Gender-Neutral Language:** Replaced ""as a policewoman"" with ""during my career in law enforcement"" to avoid specifying gender and to match the friend’s preference for they/them pronouns. This change not only respects the individual's pronouns but also broadens the context to a professional field, which can sound more inclusive and current.

These revisions ensure the sentence is respectful and polished while maintaining clarity and professionalism."
2515,"I’d hunted down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars and drug dealers as a policewoman.","I had tracked down and arrested murderers, rapists, burglars, and drug dealers during my time as a police officer.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Verb Tense (""had tracked down"" instead of ""I'd hunted down""):** 
   - The use of ""had tracked down"" clarifies the past completed nature of her experience and adds a slightly more formal tone. ""Tracked down"" may feel more precise and professional than ""hunted down.""

1. **""Lastly"" instead of ""Finally""**: While both terms serve the purpose of concluding points, ""lastly"" is often used in writing to indicate the final point being made, which can sound a bit more formal and polished.

2. **""aiming to produce"" instead of ""trying to write""**: This choice of words conveys a more deliberate action and adds clarity to the sentence.

3. **""formal, unbiased academic paper"" instead of ""formal academic treatise free of bias""**: This change streamlines the phrasing and makes it more concise and direct. ""Unbiased"" is a more commonly used term than ""free of bias"" and fits well with ""formal.""

**Explanation of the changes:**

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**: The sentence has been restructured for clarity. By breaking it into two sentences, the first part establishes what the content is not, and the second part clarifies what it is.

2. **Acknowledge Bias**: The phrase ""I acknowledge that"" has been added to explicitly recognize the presence of bias, which creates transparency and gives the statement a straightforward tone.

3. **Specificity of Perspective**: The wording now specifies that it is ""a personal account from my perspective as a police officer."" This adds clarity about the nature of the narrative and frames the reader's understanding.

4. **Redundancy Reduction**: The phrase ""police-related mental health incidents"" was made more concise by rephrasing it to ""mental health incidents related to police work."" This slightly reduces redundancy and enhances readability.

5. **Viewpoint Reasoning**: The term ""adopting this viewpoint"" is used instead of ""there are reasons for that"" to provide a clear link to the rationale, implying that the reasons for this perspective are discussed elsewhere in the text.

1. **Simplified Language:**
   - ""Far too much rubbish"" is revised to ""too many items,"" which is more neutral and clear. The word ""rubbish"" might sound overly aggressive or informal for an 'About Me' page.
   
2. **Clarified Structure:**
   - The phrase ""described as 'Fine' or 'Very Fine'"" is directly tied to ""items"" for clearer sentence structure, ensuring readers immediately understand what is being mislabeled.

3. **Grammar Improvement:**
   - ""Such a practise"" was spelled incorrectly as ""practise"" (note: ""practise"" is the British spelling for the verb; the noun form is ""practice"" in American English). Changing to ""such practices"" reflects correct plural usage, since it refers to general occurrences, and is appropriate in both dialects.
   
4. **Flow and Clarity:**
   - The phrase ""which to me as a retired police officer amounts to fraud"" now reads, ""which, to me as a retired police officer, amount to fraud,"" clarifying the subject-verb agreement and making the sentence flow more smoothly with clearer parenthetical information.

1. **Reordered sentence structure**: Starting the sentence with ""These days"" provides a contextual backdrop right off the bat and helps in drawing the reader in.

2. **Simplified phrase**: ""Far too much rubbish described as"" was adjusted to ""too many items labeled as."" This change maintains the emphasis on frequent mislabeling and uses more direct language.

3. **Removed redundant phrasing**: ""Refuse to be part of such a practise"" was simplified to ""refuse to engage in."" This streamlines the sentence, maintaining clarity without excessive wording.

1. **Rephrasing the Beginning:** The sentence starts with ""These days, there's an abundance of items falsely advertised...,"" which makes it clearer and more direct. It avoids overly casual language like ""far too much rubbish.""

2. **Concision and Clarity:** The phrase ""an abundance of items falsely advertised as 'Fine' or 'Very Fine,'"" provides a more straightforward depiction of the issue without being overly wordy.

3. **Clarity on Practices:** Using ""practices"" instead of ""practise"" is correct in this context because ""practices"" is the noun form, while ""practise"" (in British English) is a verb. Since we're describing actions, the noun form is appropriate here.

4. **Punctuation and Structure:** The commas added around ""as a retired police officer"" help to clarify that this is additional information about the speaker, thereby separating it smoothly from the main clause. 

These adjustments make the message more precise, structured, and grammatically correct while maintaining the original intent."

As a retired police officer, I refuse to partake in such practices, which, in my view, amount to fraud.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Simplified Language**: The phrase ""Far too much rubbish described as 'Fine' or 'Very Fine' is offered for sale these days"" was streamlined to ""Too often, items described as 'Fine' or 'Very Fine' are misleadingly offered for sale."" This reduces repetition and clarifies the frequency of the practice.

2. **Clearer Subject**: Changing ""rubbish"" to ""items"" specifies what is being discussed, which helps in maintaining formal tone consistency, especially for an 'About Me' page.

   - ""Far too much rubbish described as 'Fine' or 'Very Fine' is offered for sale these days"" was rephrased to ""These days, far too many items are misleadingly labeled as 'Fine' or 'Very Fine' for sale"" to avoid starting the sentence with ""Far too much rubbish,"" which might come off as informal and slightly unclear. The revised version clearly communicates the problem with misleading labels.

   - Added commas around the phrase ""as a retired police officer"" to set it off as an explanatory or parenthetical phrase, making it clearer that it's an aside explaining the speaker's perspective.

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**: The original sentence's first clause, ""Far too much rubbish described as 'Fine' or 'Very Fine' is offered for sale these days,"" was rephrased to, ""These days, many items labeled as 'Fine' or 'Very Fine' fall short of those descriptions,"" for better clarity and flow.

4. **Consistency in Terminology**: Changed ""policeman"" to ""police officer"" to ensure gender neutrality and accuracy.

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**: The original phrase ""Far too much rubbish"" has been revised to ""too many items"" for a more neutral and less colloquial tone.

1. **""Far too much rubbish"" to ""many items""**: The phrase ""far too much rubbish"" is subjective and can sound a bit harsh. ""Many items"" is a more neutral and clearer expression that doesn’t carry a negative bias but still conveys the point.

2. **""described as"" to ""labeled as""**: ""Labeled"" is a more precise term for indicating misrepresentation in the context of sales, as it signifies how items are presented to potential buyers.

3. **""these days"" to ""nowadays""**: ""Nowadays"" is a more common and fluid expression for referring to the current time.

4. **""be part of such a practise"" to ""engage in such practices""**: ""Engage in"" more accurately captures participation or involvement.

4. **Correct Spelling**: ""Practise"" is often used in British English as a verb; however, since it is being used as a noun here, ""practice"" is appropriate.

5. **Changed ‘Pratise’ to ‘Practice’:** Corrected the spelling of ""practise"" to ""practice,"" reflecting American English spelling. If British English spelling was intended, then ""practise"" should remain.

1. **Clarity and Flow**: I rearranged the sentence structure to improve clarity and flow. ""These days, there's an overwhelming amount of items falsely advertised"" provides a clear subject and verb early in the sentence.

   - The word ""policewoman"" is replaced with ""police officer"" for a more gender-neutral term, which is especially appropriate for reflecting a nonbinary identity.

3. **Use of a semicolon:**
   - I replaced the comma after ""ambitions"" with a semicolon. This provides a clearer separation between the two independent clauses: ""As a child, I had many ambitions"" and ""I wanted to be a teacher, a police officer, and a beautician!""

   - Changed the comma after ""ambitions"" to a colon. A colon is used here to introduce a list of specific ambitions.
   
2. **Consistency and Inclusivity in Terminology:**

3. **Exclamation Point Retained:**
   - The exclamation point at the end of the sentence is kept as it effectively conveys enthusiasm and excitement about the childhood ambitions.

3. **""Policewoman"" to ""police officer""**: Changed ""policewoman"" to ""police officer"" to use a gender-neutral term for the profession, which is common in modern language usage. Even though your friend is male and this is an 'About Me' page, it maintains consistency with current language practices, unless specifying gender is particularly intended.

4. **""and"" to ""or""**: Changed ""and"" to ""or"" to better communicate that these were alternative ambitions rather than cumulative ones."
2844,"As a child I had many ambitions, I wanted to be a teacher, a policewoman and a beautician!","As a child, I had many ambitions:  I wanted to be a teacher, a police officer, and a beautician!","Explanation of changes:**

2. **Use of a semicolon:** Replacing the comma with a semicolon connects the two independent clauses more effectively. It helps to emphasize the second part of the sentence while maintaining the connection between the two thoughts.

3. **""Police officer"" instead of ""policewoman"":** Using ""police officer"" is more inclusive and reflects modern, gender-neutral language. While ""policewoman"" is not incorrect, ""police officer"" is the preferred term in many contexts to avoid gender-specific roles.

These changes help make the sentence clearer, more inclusive, and stylistically fitting for an 'About Me' page."
2846,"As a child I had many ambitions, I wanted to be a teacher, a policewoman and a beautician!","As a child, I had many ambitions; I wanted to be a teacher, a police officer, and a beautician.","Explanation of Changes:**

2. **Replaced ""policewoman"" with ""police officer""**: Using ""police officer"" is more inclusive and gender-neutral, reflecting modern language standards.

1. **Removed ""also"":** The word ""also"" can be redundant in this context because the sentence already contrasts light and dark sides by implication. Removing it can make the sentence more direct.

2. **Changed ""which"" to ""that"":** In this context, ""that"" is more appropriate because it introduces a restrictive clause that is essential to the meaning of the sentence.

3. **Simplified ""experience again and again"" to ""encounter repeatedly"":** This change helps make the sentence more concise. ""Encounter"" is more specific than ""experience,"" and ""repeatedly"" conveys the frequency clearly.

1. **""But also its dark sides"" to ""But its darker sides are also""**: This change provides a smoother and more grammatically correct transition. ""Darker sides"" gives a slightly more vivid expression of contrast.

2. **""constant companions, which I experience again and again"" to ""constant companions, which I encounter repeatedly""**: ""Encounter repeatedly"" is a more concise and varied way of expressing the ongoing experience, as ""experience again and again"" is somewhat repetitive in itself.

These changes aim to maintain the original meaning while enhancing readability and clarity."
2852,"But also its dark sides are constant companions, which I experience again and again as a passionate kitesurfer, in my profession as a police officer and in everyday life.","However, its darker sides are constant companions that I encounter repeatedly as a passionate kitesurfer, in my profession as a police officer, and in everyday life.","Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Replacing ""But also"" with ""However""**: The word ""However"" provides a smoother transition and contrasts with what might have been written before this sentence. It signals a shift in perspective or tone more effectively.

2. **Changing ""its dark sides"" to ""its darker sides""**: The word ""darker"" can be more evocative, suggesting varying degrees of challenge or adversity rather than an absolute.

3. **Rephrasing ""which I experience again and again"" to ""that I encounter repeatedly""**: This change clarifies the sentence structure and uses ""encounter,"" which is slightly more formal and fits better with the professional tone of the rest of the sentence.

4. **Grammar and punctuation clarity**: The addition of commas after ""kitesurfer"" and ""officer"" helps to clearly separate the clauses, making the sentence easier to read and understand.

These adjustments provide better sentence structure and smooth transitions, enhancing the overall readability without changing the intended meaning."
2854,"But also its dark sides are constant companions, which I experience again and again as a passionate kitesurfer, in my profession as a police officer and in everyday life.","However, I've found that its darker sides are constant companions that I encounter repeatedly, whether I'm passionately kitesurfing, working as a police officer, or navigating everyday life.","Explanation of changes made:
1. **Starting with ""However""**: Using ""However"" instead of ""But also"" provides a smoother transition from whatever precedes this contextually, adding emphasis to the contrast with what's likely mentioned elsewhere in the 'About Me'.

1. **Transition word (""However"")**: Replacing ""But"" with ""However"" makes the sentence sound more formal and cohesive. ""However"" is typically used to introduce a contrast more elegantly in professional or public writing.

2. **Possessive form (""darker sides"")**: Changing ""dark sides"" to ""darker sides"" adds a comparative nuance, suggesting a greater degree of challenge or difficulty, which enhances the depth of expression.

3. **Clarity with 'that':** Replacing ""which"" with ""that"" because it introduces essential information about ""constant companions."" In American English, ""that"" is commonly used for restrictive clauses, which seem appropriate here.

4. **Word choice (""encounter repeatedly"")**: Using ""encounter repeatedly"" in place of ""experience again and again"" is more concise and formal, maintaining variety without altering the intended meaning.

5. **Punctuation (commas)**: Adding a comma after ""police officer"" improves the readability of the list by clearly separating the items.
