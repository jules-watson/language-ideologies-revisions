### Changes Made and Explanations:

1. **""But"" to ""However"":**
   - ""However"" is used to introduce a contrast more formally and is more appropriate for written content, especially on a professional website.

   - A comma is needed after transitional words like ""However"" to properly separate it from the rest of the sentence and improve readability.

3. **""Due to"" instead of ""because"":**

4. **Adding Article ""the"" before ""difficulty"":**
   - Using ""the difficulty"" clarifies the noun phrase and makes the sentence flow more smoothly.

5. **Introducing Conjunction ""and"" with a Comma:**
   - A comma before ""and"" is necessary to separate the two independent clauses.

6. **Simplified ""a place to work in the creative field was hard to find"":**
   - ""The difficulty of finding a job in the creative field"" is clearer and more concise.

7. **""Retail businessperson"" instead of ""businessperson in retail"":**
   - ""Retail businessperson"" is more straightforward and typical in English syntax, making it sound more natural.

8. **Clarified Time Reference ""a few years later"":**
   - Placing ""a few years later"" at the end of the sentence improves the chronological flow of events.

1. **""I am a professionally trained engineer""**: 
   - **Original:** ""I'm an engineer both by schooling and career choice""
   - **Improved:** ""I am a professionally trained engineer""
   - **Reason:** This captures both your educational background and career choice in a more concise and professional manner.

2. **""an enthusiastic outdoorswoman""**:
   - **Original:** ""an avid outdoorsman""
   - **Improved:** ""an enthusiastic outdoorswoman""
   - **Reason:** The term ""outdoorswoman"" is used to reflect your gender accurately, and ""enthusiastic"" conveys a sense of passion more energetically.

   - **Original:** ""a decent cook to boot""
   - **Improved:** ""a competent cook""
   - **Reason:** The term ""competent"" still conveys you are good at cooking, and removing ""to boot"" makes the sentence more straightforward and polished.

1. **Rephrased ""outdoorsman""**: 
   - ""Outdoorsman"" is typically a gender-specific term that can be replaced with a gender-neutral phrase. ""Outdoor enthusiast"" serves this purpose well and is more inclusive.

   - This phrase was somewhat awkward and less direct. Changing it to ""with a deep love for the backcountry"" makes it clearer and more succinct.

3. **Consistent Use of Terms**:
   - ""back country"" should be consistently written as ""backcountry"" since it's more commonly used as a single word.
  
4. **List Simplification**:
   - By directly stating “My passions include,” the sentence feels more personal and engaged. This also sets up the list in a way that flows more naturally.

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**: 
   - ""Therefore, if you want to read my blogs more often, you can be sure that you cannot be sure that I will publish on a regular basis"" was quite convoluted. Simplifying it to ""while I hope you'll enjoy my blogs, I can't guarantee a regular publishing schedule"" makes it clearer and more concise.

2. **Tone and Friendliness**: 
   - Putting ""I hope you'll enjoy my blogs"" adds a friendly and inviting tone to the message, making it more appealing to readers.

3. **Consistency**: 
   - The phrase ""you can be sure that you cannot be sure"" was contradictory and unclear. Rephrasing it into ""I can't guarantee a regular publishing schedule"" provides a clear and honest expectation.

4. **Suitability of Terms**: 
   - Changing ""outdoorsman"" to ""avid outdoors enthusiast"" makes the term gender-neutral and aligns better with your preference as a woman while maintaining the meaning.

5. **Engaging**:

**Original Sentence:** After seeing many more workmates take their own lives than the years that I have been a fireman, I realized that the stress we face is a cumulative and permanent reality of our profession.

**Improved Sentence:** Witnessing numerous colleagues take their own lives over my years as a firefighter made me realize that the stress we face is a cumulative and enduring aspect of our profession.

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **""After seeing"" to ""Witnessing"":** This change makes the sentence more concise and powerful.
   
2. **""many more workmates take their own lives than the years that I have been a fireman"" to ""numerous colleagues take their own lives over my years as a firefighter"":**
   - ""many more workmates"" becomes ""numerous colleagues"" for clarity and brevity.
   - ""the years that I have been a fireman"" becomes ""my years as a firefighter"" for a smoother and more direct phrase.
   - The comparison (""more workmates than years"") is removed for clarity, focusing on the emotional impact rather than the numerical comparison.

3. **""I realized that"" to ""made me realize that"":** Slight restructuring for smoother flow and to tie the cause-and-effect relationship more strongly.

4. **""cumulative and permanent reality"" to ""cumulative and enduring aspect"":** 
   - ""Permanent reality"" is changed to ""enduring aspect"" to soften the tone and to better convey that the stress is long-lasting without implying it is unchangeable.

1. **""After serving as a police officer for 14 years""**

   - **Change**: ""I felt that the time was right"" to ""I decided it was time"".
   - **Reason**: ""Decided"" is a stronger, more decisive word than ""felt"". It conveys a sense of purposeful action.

   - **Change**: ""the opportunity to work from home"" to ""embrace the opportunity to work from home"".
   - **Reason**: ""Embrace"" adds a positive and proactive connotation to the sentence, showing excitement and acceptance.

6. **""Activities that bring me joy and pride""**
   - **Change**: ""all that made me happy and proud"" to ""activities that bring me joy and pride"".
   - **Reason**: This phrase is more specific and clear. ""Activities"" focuses on the specific things you're doing, and ""bring me joy and pride"" is present tense, making the sentence feel more immediate and relevant to the present.

4. **Breaking down the sentence** – Splitting the original sentence into two makes it more digestible and clear. This separation helps in emphasizing both the decision and its impact individually.

5. **""This transition allowed me to fully immerse myself""** – By referring to your change in lifestyle as a ""transition,"" it clearly indicates a shift or change. ""Fully immerse myself"" is more concise and dynamic than ""submersing myself.""

2. **Active Voice:**
   - Changing ""which has had me pondering on being"" to ""which has led me to consider careers as"" shifts from a passive to a more active tone, making the sentence more dynamic.

3. **Removed Redundancy:**
   - ""Pondering on being"" was replaced with ""consider careers as."" The word ""careers"" ensures clarity and eliminates unnecessary words.

4. **Consistency and Flow:**
   - The enumeration of professions (police officer, lawyer, social worker, and teacher) was kept consistent by removing the unnecessary conjunction ""a"" before each profession. This maintains the parallel structure.

**Original Sentence:**
""But at that point I made a decision that I wanted to become a weatherman.""

**Improved Sentence:**
""At that moment, I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in meteorology.""

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **""But"" to ""At that moment""**: The word ""But"" is a conjunction that typically introduces a contrast or exception. In this context, it's not necessary and can be omitted. ""At that moment"" is a more precise and engaging way to introduce the timing of your decision.

2. **""Made a decision that I wanted to"" to ""decided that I wanted to""**: ""Made a decision"" is a bit verbose. ""Decided"" is more direct and concise while conveying the same meaning.

3. **""Become a weatherman"" to ""pursue a career in meteorology""**: 
    - ""Weatherman"" is a gender-specific and somewhat casual term. Since you are a woman, opting for a gender-neutral term like ""meteorologist"" would be more appropriate.
    - ""Pursue a career in meteorology"" has a more professional and ambitious tone compared to simply ""becoming a weatherman."" It suggests a dedicated and serious commitment to the field.

Original sentence:
There are many similar pictures — I personally made a lot of them in the mountains — but with clear blue sky, or with natural clouds (I also worked for many years as a meteorologist at high mountain weather station, and am very familiar with the weather phenomenon).

Improved sentence:
Many of the photos I have taken in the mountains feature stunning clear blue skies or natural cloud formations. With my extensive experience as a meteorologist at a high-altitude weather station, I have developed a deep understanding of these weather phenomena.

Explanation of changes:
1. **Sentence structure and clarity**: The original sentence was somewhat convoluted and hard to follow. I broke it into two distinct sentences for clarity and flow.
  
2. **Subject focus**: Reframing the beginning to clearly state ""Many of the photos I have taken"" makes the subject of the sentence obvious and immediate.

3. **Simplified phrases**: Phrases like ""I personally made a lot of them in the mountains"" were simplified to ""I have taken in the mountains."" This is more concise and easier to read.

4. **Natural transitions**: The phrase ""but with clear blue sky, or with natural clouds"" was transitioned more smoothly into ""feature stunning clear blue skies or natural cloud formations,"" adding descriptors like ""stunning"" for a more engaging description.

5. **Work experience**: The work experience was rearranged to fit naturally into the second sentence, enhancing readability and coherence. ""I also worked for many years as a meteorologist at a high mountain weather station"" was rephrased as ""With my extensive experience as a meteorologist at a high-altitude weather station,"" which flows better.
