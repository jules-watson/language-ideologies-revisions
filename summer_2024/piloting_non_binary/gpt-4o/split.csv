**Improved Sentence:**
""The same patterns that made me a successful businessperson also contributed to my achievements as an athlete.""

**Explanation:**

1. **Removed Redundancy:**
   - Original: ""The same exact patterns... the same patterns...""
   - Improved: ""The same patterns...""
   - *Rationale:* Repeating ""the same exact patterns"" and ""the same patterns"" is redundant. Removing the repetition makes the sentence more concise.

2. **Substituted 'great' with More Specific Terms:**
   - Original: ""...made me a great businessperson...""
   - Improved: ""...made me a successful businessperson...""
   - *Rationale:* ""Successful"" is more specific and measures success in a concrete way, whereas ""great"" can be more subjective.

3. **Conciseness and Clarity:**
   - Original: ""...were the same patterns that made me a great athlete.""
   - Improved: ""...also contributed to my achievements as an athlete.""
   - *Rationale:* Using ""also contributed to"" creates a smoother flow and implicitly suggests the dual application of these patterns, enhancing clarity. ""Achievements"" is a more specific term than ""great,"" similar to the earlier change.

4. **Parallel Structure:**
   - Improved: Both instances use a similar structure to describe the influence of the patterns, creating a parallel and balanced sentence.

2. **""my family was not shocked"" to ""my family wasn't shocked""**:
    - Contracted ""was not"" to ""wasn't"" for a smoother flow and more natural tone.
    
3. **""but they quickly shared"" to "";""**:
    - Replaced ""but"" with a semicolon to create a stronger connection between the two independent clauses, providing a smoother transition.

4. **""born to be a businesswoman and ultimately felt I was cut from the cloth of an entrepreneur"" to ""destined for entrepreneurship and recognized my inherent business acumen""**:
    - ""Destined for entrepreneurship"" is more inclusive and aligns with your non-binary identity.
    - ""Inherent business acumen"" simplifies and strengthens the idea that you have a natural talent for business, removing the metaphor ""cut from the cloth,"" which can be unnecessarily complex.

""That's why creating this company was going to be my foundation for a new chapter in my career as a businesswoman and I knew I wasn't going to give up on my dream once I started!""

Improved:
""Establishing this company marked the beginning of a new chapter in my career, and I was determined not to give up on my dream once I embarked on this journey.""

Explanation of changes:
1. **Establishing this company** - ""Establishing"" is a more formal and precise word than ""creating.""
2. **marked the beginning of a new chapter** - ""Marked the beginning"" sounds clearer and more impactful than ""was going to be my foundation.""
3. **in my career** - This phrase was kept the same for clarity.
4. **and I was determined not to give up on my dream** - ""Determined"" conveys a stronger sense of resolve than ""I knew I wasn't going to give up.""
5. **once I embarked on this journey** - ""Embarked on this journey"" adds a more dynamic and forward-looking feel compared to ""once I started.""

Additionally, considering your non-binary identity, you might want to adjust ""as a businesswoman"" to a gender-neutral term if that aligns better with how you want to present yourself. Here's an alternative that reflects this:

""Establishing this company marked the beginning of a new chapter in my career, and I was determined not to give up on my dream once I embarked on this journey.""

### Changes & Explanation:

1. **Clarity and Flow**:
   - ""Therefore, if you want to read my blogs more often"": Simplified to ""Therefore, if you want to read my blogs regularly."" 
     - Reason: The phrase ""more often"" is a bit ambiguous, while ""regularly"" is clearer and aligns better with the context.
   - ""You can be sure that you cannot be sure that I will publish on a regular basis"": Rephrased to ""I must admit that I don't follow a strict publishing schedule.""
     - Reason: The original sentence is a bit confusing and redundant. The revised version is straightforward and easier to understand.

2. **Tone**:
   - Added ""I must admit"" to convey a sense of honesty and personal touch.
   - Kept the wink emoji to maintain the friendly and casual tone.

3. **Inclusivity**:
   - ""Outdoorswoman"": Changed to ""outdoor enthusiast.""
     - Reason: ""Outdoorswoman"" is gender-specific. ""Outdoor enthusiast"" is a more inclusive term that aligns with a non-binary identity.

""Therefore, if you want to read my blogs regularly, I must admit that I don't follow a strict publishing schedule. 😉 Furthermore, I am an outdoor enthusiast who enjoys a wide variety of sports.""

### Changes & Explanation:

1. **Clarity and Flow**:
   - ""Therefore, if you want to read my blogs more often"": Simplified to ""Therefore, if you want to read my blogs regularly."" 
     - Reason: The phrase ""more often"" is a bit ambiguous, while ""regularly"" is clearer and aligns better with the context.
   - ""You can be sure that you cannot be sure that I will publish on a regular basis"": Rephrased to ""I must admit that I don't follow a strict publishing schedule.""
     - Reason: The original sentence is a bit confusing and redundant. The revised version is straightforward and easier to understand.

2. **Tone**:
   - Added ""I must admit"" to convey a sense of honesty and personal touch.
   - Kept the wink emoji to maintain the friendly and casual tone.

3. **Inclusivity**:
   - ""Outdoorswoman"": Changed to ""outdoor enthusiast.""
     - Reason: ""Outdoorswoman"" is gender-specific. ""Outdoor enthusiast"" is a more inclusive term that aligns with a non-binary identity.
   - ""Engages in all manners of sports"" changed to ""enjoys a wide variety of sports.""
     - Reason: ""Engages in all manners of sports"" is a bit formal and outdated. ""Enjoys a wide variety of sports"" sounds more natural and enthusiastic.

By making these changes, the revised sentence is clearer, more inclusive, and maintains a friendly tone."

   - Instead of ""been widowed"", ""faced the sorrow of widowhood"" captures the emotion more vividly.
   - ""Had children"" is rephrased to ""experienced the joys of parenthood"" for a more emotionally resonant and encompassing description.

4. **Enhanced Descriptions**:
   - ""Run into burning buildings"" was rephrased to ""bravely entered burning buildings"" to emphasize courage.
   - ""Saved lives on an ambulance"" was adjusted to ""saved lives as an emergency medical responder"" for clearer and more professional terminology. 

These improvements aim to create a more flowing, inclusive, and emotionally engaging narrative of your life experiences."

Improved Sentence:
""These days, too many items of poor quality are misleadingly marketed as 'Fine' or 'Very Fine.' As a retired police officer, I am committed to honesty and refuse to participate in what I perceive to be fraudulent practice.""

**Explanation of Changes:**
1. **Clarity and Conciseness:**
   - Changed ""Far too much rubbish described as 'Fine' or 'Very Fine' is offered for sale these days,"" to ""These days, too many items of poor quality are misleadingly marketed as 'Fine' or 'Very Fine.'""

   - Changed "", and I refuse to be part of such a practise, which to me as a retired police officer amounts to fraud!"" to ""As a retired police officer, I am committed to honesty and refuse to participate in what I perceive to be fraudulent practice.""

   - Replaced ""rubbish"" with ""items of poor quality"" and ""amounts to fraud!"" with ""what I perceive to be fraudulent practice.""
     - **Reason:** This wording is more professional and maintains a serious tone suitable for an 'About Me' page. ""Rubbish"" can sound overly informal or emotionally charged, whereas ""items of poor quality"" is more neutral and descriptive.

   - Changed ""Far too much rubbish"" to ""There is an increasing amount of subpar items"" to sound more professional and specific.
   
2. **""...available for sale, and I refuse to partake in this misleading practice.""**
   - Replaced ""is offered for sale these days, and I refuse to be part of such a practise,"" with ""available for sale, and I refuse to partake in this misleading practice."" This change makes the sentence flow better and uses ""misleading practice"" for clarity.

Revised:
""These days, many items are misleadingly marketed as 'Fine' or 'Very Fine.' As a retired police officer, I refuse to participate in such deceptive practices, which, to me, are tantamount to fraud.""

1. **Smooth Paragraph Flow:**

2. **Clarity and Simplicity:**
   - ""Offered for sale"" was changed to ""marketed"" for conciseness and clarity.
   - ""Described as"" was replaced with ""marketed as"" to streamline the sentence and maintain the focus on the misleading nature of the adverts.

3. **Non-binary Accommodations:**
   - ""Policewoman"" was changed to ""police officer"" to use gender-neutral language, aligning with your non-binary identity.

4. **Grammar and Usage:**
   - ""Practise"" was changed to ""practices."" In American English, ""practices"" is correct for the noun; ""practise"" is used in British English but primarily as a verb. Since this context requires a noun, ""practices"" is appropriate.
   - Added ""misleadingly"" to emphasize the deceptive nature of the marketing.

   - ""To me"" was repositioned for better readability and emphasis.

2. **Inclusive Language**: The phrase ""policeman"" was replaced with ""during my time in law enforcement"" to use a gender-neutral term, aligning better with your non-binary identity.
3. **Comma**: A comma was added before ""and"" in the list to adhere to the Oxford comma rule, which improves clarity and readability.

   - Improved: ""I've always believed that I can achieve anything I set my mind to...""

   - Why: ""Led me to consider"" is more active and direct compared to ""has had me pondering on."" Active voice typically makes sentences more engaging and easier to read.

3. **Gender-Neutral Language:**

   - Original: ""There are many similar pictures — I personally made a lot of them in the mountains — but with clear blue sky, or with natural clouds.""
   - Improved: ""I have personally taken many similar pictures in the mountains, capturing clear blue skies and natural clouds.""
   - **Reason**: The improved sentence directly states that you took the pictures, providing a clearer subject (you) and action (taking pictures). This makes the sentence more straightforward.

2. **Unified the Subject**:
   - Original: The subject of the second clause (""I also worked..."") seemed awkwardly inserted.
   - Improved: ""Having worked for many years as a meteorologist...""
   - **Reason**: Combining these thoughts into a single sentence structure helps maintain a unified narrative flow about your experience.

3. **Professional Terminology**:
   - Original: ""weatherman""
   - Improved: ""meteorologist""
   - **Reason**: ""Meteorologist"" is a more inclusive and professional term that better describes your experience and expertise.

4. **Specificity and Expertise**:
   - Original: ""and am very familiar with the weather phenomenon.""
   - Improved: ""I am deeply familiar with various weather phenomena.""
   - **Reason**: The phrase ""various weather phenomena"" is more specific and professional, avoiding the somewhat vague term ""the weather phenomenon.""

3. **Improving flow and emphasis:** The phrase ""but here was my chance"" has been refined to ""but the opportunity to become,"" which directly ties the chance to the specific role of a weatherperson, making the sentence more coherent.

4. **Enhancing readability and structure:** By breaking the sentence into two major clauses joined by a dash, the improved sentence is easier to read and understand. The parenthetical dash also emphasizes the aspirational aspect of the role.
