Explanation of changes:
1. **Changed ""looked"" to ""appeared""**: This alteration provides a slightly more formal and polished tone, augmenting the impact of Alex's handsomeness in the photo.

2. **Added ""strikingly""**: The inclusion of ""strikingly"" as an adverb intensifies the adjective ""handsome,"" emphasizing the exceptional nature of Alexâ€™s appearance.

3. **Changed ""the photo"" to ""the photograph""**: Substituting ""photo"" with ""photograph"" lends a more formal air to the sentence, aligning with the overall enhanced tone and providing a touch of elegance."""
